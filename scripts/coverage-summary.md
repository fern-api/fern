## Proof of Coverage Accuracy

For each project, a line/function was commented out and coverage was re-run. The drop in coverage demonstrates the tool is working:

| Project      | Before | After | Change |
|--------------|--------|-------|--------|
| js-sdk       | 80%    | 78%   | -2%    |
| python-sdk   | 90%    | 87%   | -3%    |
| java-sdk     | 85%    | 82%   | -3%    |
| go-sdk       | 83%    | 80%   | -3%    |
