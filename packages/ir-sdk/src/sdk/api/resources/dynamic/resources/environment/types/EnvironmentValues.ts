 *
 * 1. When sent as an EnvironmentId string, the generator assumes the value matches the name of the
 * environment (e.g. "Staging"), and returns an error otherwise.
 *
 * 2. If the API supports multiple environment URLs, send a map of URLs, e.g.
 *   {
 *     "ec2": "https://staging.ec2.aws.com",
 *     "s3": "https://staging.s3.aws.com"
