  FernFilepath:
    docs: |
      The literal filepath to this definition within the Fern definition, note that directories within the Fern definition
      denote packages/subpackages which are namespaces, so across subpackages names (for objects, endpoints, etc.) may be
      shared, however within the file itself (e.g. the service) names cannot be duplicated.

  EscapedString:
    docs: |
      Defines the original string, and its escaped-equivalent (depending on the target programming language).
      This is particularly relevant to example string literals.

      For example, in Python we escape strings that contain single or double quotes by using triple quotes,
      in Go we use backticks, etc.
