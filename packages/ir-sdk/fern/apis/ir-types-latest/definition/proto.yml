types:
  ProtobufService:
    docs: |
      Defines the information related to a Protobuf service declaration. This is
      primarily meant to be used to instantiate the internal gRPC client used by
      the SDK.

      For example, consider the following C# snippet which instantiates a
      `UserService` gRPC client:

      ```csharp
      using User.Grpc;

      public class RawGrpcClient
      {
          public UserService.UserServiceClient UserServiceClient;
          
          public RawGrpcClient(...)
          {
              GrpcChannel channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress(...);
              UserServiceClient = new UserService.UserServiceClient(channel); 
          }
      }
      ```
    properties:
      file:
        docs: |
          The `.proto` source file that defines this service.
        type: ProtobufFile
      name:
        docs: |
          The name of the service defined in the `.proto` file (e.g. UserService).
        type: commons.Name

  ProtobufType:
    docs: |
      A Protobuf type declaration.
    union:
      wellKnown: WellKnownProtobufType
      userDefined: UserDefinedProtobufType

  UserDefinedProtobufType:
    docs: |
      Defines the information related to the original `.proto` source file
      that defines this type. This is primarily meant to be used to generate
      Protobuf mapper methods, which are used in gRPC-compatbile SDKs.

      For example, consider the following Go snippet which requires the
      `go_package` setting:

      ```go
      import "github.com/acme/acme-go/proto"

      type GetUserRequest struct {
        Username string
        Email    string
      }

      func (u *GetUserRequest) ToProto() *proto.GetUserRequest {
        if u == nil {
          return nil
        }
        return &proto.GetUserRequest{
          Username u.Username,
          Email:   u.Email,
        }
      }
      ```
    properties:
      file:
        docs: |
          The `.proto` source file that defines this type.
        type: ProtobufFile
      name:
        docs: |
          This name is _usually_ equivalent to the associated DeclaredTypeName's name.
          However, its repeated here just in case the naming convention differs, which
          is most relevant for APIs that specify `smart-casing`.
        type: commons.Name

  WellKnownProtobufType:
    docs: |
      The set of well-known types supported by Protobuf. These types are often included
      in the target runtime library, so they usually require special handling.

      The full list of well-known types can be found at https://protobuf.dev/reference/protobuf/google.protobuf

  ProtobufFile:
    properties:
      filepath:
        docs: |
          The `.proto` source path, relative to the Protobuf root directory.
          This is how the file is referenced in `import` statements.
        type: string
      packageName:
        docs: |
          The `.proto` package name. If not specified, a package name was not declared.
        type: optional<string>
      options:
        docs: |
          Specifies a variety of language-specific options.
        type: optional<ProtobufFileOptions>

  ProtobufFileOptions:
    properties:
      csharp: optional<CsharpProtobufFileOptions>

  CsharpProtobufFileOptions:
    properties:
      namespace:
        docs: |
          Populated by the `csharp_namespace` file option, e.g.

          ```protobuf
          option csharp_namespace = Grpc.Health.V1;
          ```

          This is used to determine what import path is required to reference the
          associated type(s).
        type: string

  ProtobufMethod:
    enum:
      - UNARY
      - CLIENT_STREAM
      - SERVER_STREAM
      - BIDIRECTIONAL_STREAM
