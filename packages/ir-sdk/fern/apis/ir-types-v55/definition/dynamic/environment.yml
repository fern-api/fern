      Represents the value to use for a specific environment. There are three cases:
      
      1. When sent as an EnvironmentId string, the generator assumes the value matches the name of the
      environment (e.g. "Staging"), and returns an error otherwise.
      
      2. If the API supports multiple environment URLs, send a map of URLs, e.g.
        {
          "ec2": "https://staging.ec2.aws.com",
          "s3": "https://staging.s3.aws.com"
        }

    union:
      - environment.EnvironmentId
      - MultipleEnvironmentUrlValues

  MultipleEnvironmentUrlValues: map<environment.EnvironmentBaseUrlId, environment.EnvironmentUrl>
