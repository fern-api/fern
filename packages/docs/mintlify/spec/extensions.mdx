Fern supports different OpenAPI extensions so that you can generate higher-quality SDKs.
If there's an extension you want that doesn't already exist, file an [issue](https://github.com/fern-api/fern/issues/new).

## SDK method names

By default, Fern uses the `tag` and `operationId` fields to generate the SDK method. So an endpoint with a
tag `users` and operationId `users_create` will generate an SDK that reads `client.users.create()`.

To explicitly set the SDK method you can leverage the extensions:

- `x-fern-sdk-group-name` which groups SDK methods together
- `x-fern-sdk-method-name` which is used as the method name in the SDK

The OpenAPI below will `client.users.create()`:

```yaml openapi.yaml
paths:
  /users
    post:
      x-fern-sdk-group-name: users
      x-fern-sdk-method-name: create
```

If you omit the `x-fern-sdk-group-name` extension, then the generated SDK method will live at the root.
For example, the following OpenAPI will generate `client.create_user()`:

```yaml openapi.yaml
paths:
  /users:
    post:
      x-fern-sdk-method-name: create_user
```

## Enum descriptions and names

OpenAPI doesn't natively support adding descriptions to enum values. To do this in Fern you can use the `x-fern-enum`
extension.

In the example below, we've added some descriptions to enum values. These descriptions will
propagate into the generated SDK and docs website.

```yaml openapi.yml
components:
  schemas:
    CardSuit:
      enum:
        - clubs
        - diamonds
        - hearts
        - spades
      x-fern-enum: # <------
        clubs:
          description: Some docs about clubs
        spades:
          description: Some docs about spades
```

`x-fern-enum` also supports a `name` field that allows you to customize the name of the enum in code.
This is particularly useful when you have enums that rely on symbolic characters that would otherwise cause
generated code not to compile.

For example, the following OpenAPI

```yaml openapi.yml
components:
  schemas:
    Operand:
      enum:
        - >
        - <
      x-fern-enum:
        >:
          name: GreaterThan
          description: Checks if value is greater than
        <:
          name: LessThan
          description: Checks if value is less than
```

would generate

```typescript operand.ts
export enum Operand {
  GreaterThan = ">",
  LessThan = "<",
}
```

## Schema names

OpenAPI allows you to define inlined schemas that do not have names.

```yaml openapi.yml
components:
  schemas:
    Movie:
      type: object
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        cast:
          type: array
          items:
            type: object # <---------- Inline Type
            properties:
              firstName:
                type: string
              lastName:
                type: string
              age:
                type: integer
```

Fern automatically generates names for all the inlined schemas. For example, in this example,
Fern would generate the name `CastItem` for the inlined array item schema.

```typescript
export interface Movie {
    name?: string;
    cast?: CastItem[]
}

export interface CastItem  { # <----- Auto-generated name
    firstName?: string;
    lastName?: string;
    age?: integer;
}
```

If you want to override the generated name, you can use the extension `x-fern-type-name`.

```yaml openapi.yml
components:
  schemas:
    Movie:
      type: object
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        cast:
          type: array
          items:
            type: object
            x-fern-type-name: Person # <----------
            properties:
              firstName:
                type: string
              lastName:
                type: string
              age:
                type: integer
```

This would replace `CastItem` with `Person` and the generated code would read more idiomatically:

```typescript
export interface Movie {
    name?: string;
    cast?: Person[]
}

export interface Person  { # <----- Overridden name
    firstName?: string;
    lastName?: string;
    age?: integer;
}
```
