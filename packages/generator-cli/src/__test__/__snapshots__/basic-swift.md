The Basic Swift library provides convenient access to the Basic APIs from Swift.

## Installation

With Swift Package Manager (SPM), add the following to the top-level `dependencies` array within your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/fern-api/basic-swift-sdk", from: "0.1.0"),
]
```

## Contributing

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Additions made directly to this library would have to be moved over to our generation code,
otherwise they would be overwritten upon the next generated release. Feel free to open a PR as
a proof of concept, but know that we will not be able to merge it as-is. We suggest opening
an issue first to discuss with us!

On the other hand, contributions to the README are always very welcome!
