Once you have onboarded one of your customers to Layer by creating a [Business](/api-reference/business), you can start importing their financial data into Layer. This allows you to build the complete picture of financial activity to do their accounting. Layer can ingest the below types of data:
* [Invoices & Payments](/guides/importing-invoices) - The revenue collected by your business customers. This can be in-person sales made through a point of sale system, invoices sent through your software, ecommerce sales, or any other type of accounts receivable activity.
* [Bank Transactions](/guides/importing-bank-transactions) - Activity within your customers' business bank accounts and credit cards.
* **Payroll** - Payroll runs for paying employees and associated payroll taxes. Currently in Beta. Reach out to your Layer contact for access.
* **Bills** - Bills sent to your customers for their accounts payable obligations. Currently in Beta. Reach out to your Layer contact for access.
