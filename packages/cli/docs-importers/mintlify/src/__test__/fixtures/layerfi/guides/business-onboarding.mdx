title: 'Onboarding a Business'
description: 'Onboard one of your business customers to Layer'
---

The first step when using Layer is to onboard your customer to Layer using the [Create a business](/api-reference/create-new-business) endpoint.

This endpoint creates the record for your customer in Layerâ€™s systems. There are many optional features, such as specifying external accounts connected via Plaid. The [Create a business](/api-reference/create-new-business) endpoint lists the full set of options.

```bash Request
curl -X POST https://sandbox.layerfi.com/v1/businesses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "external_id": "test-acme-id",
    "legal_name": "ACME LLC",
    "tin": null,
    "us_state": "CA",
    "entity_type": "LLC",
    "phone_number": "+18005555555",
    "unit_ids": [{"unit_id": "111111"}]
  }'
```


### Plaid credentials
If you've added Plaid credentials (see [Plaid Configuration](/api-reference/plaid)), link Plaid accounts by including Plaid item ids & access tokens in the `plaid_items` field.
```json
"plaid_items": [
	{ "item_id": "item-id-1", "access_token": "access_token_1" },
	{ "item_id": "item-id-3", "access_token": "access_token_3" }
]
```

The Layer API will respond with the created [Business](/api-reference/business) object. Within the object will be a unique id, which you will use to make calls on behalf of the business in subsequent steps.
