### Headers

<ParamField header="authorization" type="string" required>
  Your API key for authentication.
</ParamField>

### Path Parameters

<ParamField path="agent_id" type="string">
  The web agent you'll be updating.
</ParamField>

### Body

<ParamField body="prompt" type="string" required>
    Provide instructions, relevant information, and examples of the ideal conversation flow.

    <Accordion title="Best Practices">
        #### Out-of-the-Box Behaviors (Summarized):
        - Speech pattern: Direct, concise, casual
        - Spells out symbols, acronyms, abbreviations, percentages, etc. ($4,000,000 -> "four million dollars")
        - Asks clarifying questions

        #### Prompting Tips:
        - Want to easily test out exactly how your agent will behave?
            - [Try out Agent Testing!](https://app.bland.ai/home?page=testing)
        - Aim for less than >2,000 characters where possible.
        - Simple, direct prompts are the most predictable and reliable.
        - Frame instructions positively:
            - `"Do this"` rather than `"Don't do this"`.
            - Ex. "Keep the conversation casual" rather than "Don't be too formal".
            - This gives concrete examples of what to do, instead of leaving expected behavior open to interpretation.
    </Accordion>

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="voice" type="string">
  Set your agent's voice - all available voices can be found with the [List Voices](/api-v1/get/voices) endpoint.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="analysis_schema" type="object">
  Define a JSON schema for how you want to get information about the call - information like email addresses, names, appointment times or any other type of custom data.

In the webhook response or whenever you retrieve call data later, you'll get the data you defined back under `analysis`.

For example, if you wanted to retrieve this information from the call:

```json
"analysis_schema": {
  "email_address": "email",
  "first_name": "string",
  "last_name": "string",
  "wants_to_book_appointment": "boolean",
  "appointment_time": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
}
```

You would get it filled out like this in your webhook once the call completes:

```json
"analysis": {
  "email_address": "johndoe@gmail.com",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "wants_to_book_appointment": true,
  "appointment_time": "2024-01-01 12:00:00"
}
```

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="metadata" type="object">
  Add any additional information you want to associate with the call. This can be useful for tracking or categorizing
  calls.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="pathway_id" type="string">
    Set the pathway that your agent will follow. This will override the `prompt` field, so there is no need to pass the 'prompt' field if you are setting a pathway.

    Warning: Setting a pathway will set the following fields to `null` / their default value - `prompt`, `first_sentence`, `model`, `dynamic_data`, `tools`

    Set to `null` or an empty string to clear the pathway.

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="language" type="string" default="ENG">
  Select a supported language of your choice. Optimizes every part of our API for that language - transcription, speech,
  and other inner workings. Supported Languages and their codes: - English: ```ENG``` - Spanish: ```ESP``` - French:
  ```FRE``` - Polish: ```POL``` - German: ```GER``` - Italian: ```ITA``` - Brazilian Portuguese: ```PBR``` - Portuguese:
  ```POR```
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="webhook" type="string">
  The webhook should be a http / https callback url. We will send the call_id
  and transcript to this URL after the call completes. This can be useful if you
  want to have real time notifications when calls finish.

Set to `null` or an empty string to clear the webhook.

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="model" type="string" default="enhanced">
  Select a model to use for your call.

Options: `base`, `turbo` and `enhanced`.

In nearly all cases, `enhanced` is the best choice for now.

  <Accordion title="Model Differences">

There are three different ways to use Bland:

- `model: base`

  - The original, follows scripts/procedures most effectively.
  - Supports all features and capabilities.
  - Best for Custom Tools

- `model: enhanced`

  - Much faster latency and very conversational, works best with objective-based prompts.
  - Supports all features and capabilities.

- `model: turbo`

  - The absolute fastest latency possible, can be verbose at times
  - Limited capabilities currently (excludes Transferring, IVR navigation, Custom Tools)
  - Extremely realistic conversation capabilities

        </Accordion>

    </ParamField>

<ParamField body="first_sentence" type="string">
  A phrase that your call will start with instead of a generating one on the fly. This works both with and without `wait_for_greeting`. Can be more than one sentence, but must be less than 200 characters.

To remove, set to `null` or an empty string.

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="tools" type="array">
  Interact with the real world through API calls.

Detailed tutorial here: [Custom Tools](/tutorials/custom-tools)

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="dynamic_data" type="object">
  Integrate data from external APIs into your agent's knowledge.

Set to `null` or an empty string to clear dynamic data settings.

Detailed usage in the [Send Call](/api-v1/post/calls) endpoint.

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="interruption_threshold" type="integer (milliseconds)" default={50}>
  When you increase the interruption latency, you force the AI phone agent to listen longer before responding. In practice, increasing the threshold results in less interruptions and more latency.

Try setting the threshold to `500` milliseconds. You'll encounter higher latency, but you'll be interrupted less frequently.

Set to `null` to reset to default.

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="max_duration" type="integer (minutes)" default={30}>
  The maximum duration that calls to your agent can last before being automatically terminated.

Set to `null` to reset to default.

</ParamField>

### Response

<ResponseField name="status" type="string">
  Whether the update was successful or not - will be `success` or `error`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="message" type="string">
  A message describing the status of the update.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="updates" type="object">
  An object containing the updated settings for the agent.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="failed_updates" type="object">
  If the update was unsuccessful, this will contain the settings that failed to update. Useful to determine how your
  request is being interpreted on our end.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseExample>

```json Response
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Successfully updated agent 46f37229-7d12-44be-b343-6e68274cfbea.",
  "updates": {
    "model": "enhanced"
  }
}
```
