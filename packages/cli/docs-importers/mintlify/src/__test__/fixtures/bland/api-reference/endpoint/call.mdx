### Headers

<ParamField header="authorization" type="string" required>
  Your API key for authentication.
</ParamField>
### Body

<ParamField body="phone_number" type="string" required>
  The phone number to call. Country code required for non-US numbers.

Example: `+12223334444`, `+44770090000`, `+61491550156`.

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="transfer_phone_number" type="string">
  A phone number that the agent can transfer to under specific conditions, such as when the caller/callee asks to speak to a human.

For best results, specify the exact conditions to transfer under in the `task` parameter. Refer to the action as "transfer", any other phrasing such as "swap" or "switch" can cause unexpected behavior.

Example: `+12223334444`, `+44770090000`, `+61491550156`.

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="from" type="string">
  Specify a purchased Outbound Number to call from. Country code is required, spaces or parentheses must be excluded.

By default, calls are initiated from a separate pool of numbers owned by Bland.

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="task" type="string" required>
  Define how the AI should behave. Provide instructions, relevant information, and examples of the ideal conversation flow.

Note: Concise prompts lead to higher performance and adherence to instructions. Overly verbose prompts 'dilute' the context if filled with unnecessary/irrelevant details.

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="reduce_latency" type="boolean" default="true">
  Reducing latency means that the agent will generate responses more quickly and have less of a delay. This must be set
  to ```true``` when using Voice Clones.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="voice_id" type="number" default="0">
  When reduce latency is set to `true` (default):

- 0: American male
- 1: Australian female
- 2: American female

When reduce latency is set to `false`:

- 0: American female (southern accent)
- 1: American male
- 2: British female
- 3: Indian male
  </ParamField>

<ParamField body="webhook" type="string">
  The webhook should be a http / https callback url. We will send the call_id and transcript to this URL after the call
  completes. This can be useful if you want to have real time notifications when calls finish.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="wait_for_greeting" type="boolean" default="false">
  Should the AI speak first or wait for someone else to talk?
  
  Creates more realistic conversations when answered with "Hello?", "This is \{name\} speaking." and so on.
  
  - When ```false```: The AI starts speaking shortly after the call is answered. 
  
  - When ```true```: The AI will wait for the answerer to speak.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="first_sentence" type="string">
  A phrase that your call will start with instead of a generating one on the fly. This works both with and without
  `wait_for_greeting`. Can be more than one sentence, but must be less than 200 characters.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="record" type="boolean" default="false">
  To record your phone call, set `record` to true. When your call completes, you can access the recording by requesting
  the `/call/recording` endpoint.
</ParamField>

<ResponseField name="voice_settings" type="Voice Settings Object">
  <Expandable title="properties">
  <ParamField body="stability" default="0.8" type="float">
  Note: This is an experimental parameter and may behave unexpectedly.

Adjust the predictability and consistency of the AI agent's voice. Lower values allow larger deviations from the baseline voice, whether default or cloned. Setting this too high however can cause a monotone voice.

Accepts decimal values between `0` and `1` (inclusive).

</ParamField>
<ParamField body="similarity" default="0.6" type="float">
  Note: This is an experimental parameter and may behave unexpectedly.

Higher values will make speech differences between the selected voice and others more prominent. Extremely high values can cause voice distortion.

Use lower values to lower the distinctiveness of the voice or eliminate unwanted audio static spikes.

Accepts decimal values between `0` and `1` (inclusive).

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="speed" default="0.85" type="float">
  Note: This is an experimental parameter and may behave unexpectedly.
  
  Note #2: Setting `reduce_latency` to `false` will cause this parameter to be ignored.

How fast your agent talks! This parameter is simply a speech-speed multiplier, and works with fractional values such as `0.5` or large ones like `2`.

Accepts decimal values between `0.1` and `5` (inclusive).

</ParamField>

  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ParamField body="language" type="string" default="eng">
  Select a supported language of your choice. Optimizes every part of our API for that language - transcription, speech,
  and other inner workings. Supported Languages and their codes: - English: ```eng``` - Spanish: ```esp``` - French:
  ```fre``` - Polish: ```pol```
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="max_duration" type="float or string" default="30">
  Set the longest you want the call to possibly go in minutes. After the max_duration minutes have passed, the call will automatically end.
  
  Example Values: ```"45", "5.5", 20, 2.8```
</ParamField>
<ParamField name="pronunciation_guide" type="array" description="An array of objects where each object specifies a word and its pronunciation. Additional attributes can be added as needed.">
  <Example>
    [
      {
        "word": "example",
        "pronunciation": "ex-am-ple",
        "case_sensitive": "false",
        "spaced": "false"
      },
      {
        "word": "API",
        "pronunciation": "A P I",
        "case_sensitive": "true",
        "spaced": "true"
      }
    ]
  </Example>
  <Param name="word" type="string" description="The word to be pronounced." required="true"/>
  <Param name="pronunciation" type="string" description="The pronunciation of the word." required="true"/>
  <Param name="case_sensitive" type="boolean" description="Specifies if the word matching should be case sensitive. Default is false." required="false"/>
  <Param name="spaced" type="boolean" description="Indicates whether the word should be matched as a standalone word. Default is false." required="false"/>
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="temperature" type="float" default="0.7">
  A value between 0 and 1 that controls the randomness of the LLM. 0 will cause more deterministic outputs while 1 will cause more random.
  
  Example Values: ```"0.9", "0.3", "0.5"```
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="amd" type="boolean" default="false">
  AMD mode helps our AI navigate phone trees and IVR systems. If you know your call will hit an automated system you
  should switch it on. NOTE: AMD mode causes increased delay for the first response, even if answered by a human. Highly
  recommended to set to `false` in the majority of cases.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="request_data" type="object">
  When you want your AI to "know" a specific fact - like the caller's
  name or other relevant context.

The AI agent will be aware of both the key names as well as their corresponding values.

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="dynamic_data" type="array">
 <Expandable title="properties">
  A set of external API requests to fetch at the start of the call or repeatedly.

Each request object should contain:

`url`: The URL of the external API to fetch data from.

`response_data`: An array of objects describing how to parse and use the data fetched from the API. Explained in more detail below.

The following are optional:

`method`: Allows `GET` or `POST`. Default: `GET`

`cache`: Whether to fetch the data once at the beginning of the call, or to re-check continuously for data that might change mid-call. Default: `true`

`headers`: An object of headers to send with the request.

`body`: The body of the request.

The following variables can be injected into the dynamic request body:

- `{{from}}` (Ex. `+12223334444`)
- `{{to}}`
- `{{short_from}}` (Ex. `2223334444`)
- `{{short_to}}`
- `{{call_id}}`

These string values will be replaced in each `dynamic_data[].body` where they're used by system values in each request.

Try out with this example:

```json
    "dynamic_data": [
        {
            "url": "https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json",
            "response_data": [
                {
                    "name": "BTC Price USD",
                    "data": "bpi.USD.rate",
                    "context": "Current BTC Price: ${{BTC Price USD}} USD"
                },
                {
                    "name": "BTC Price EUR",
                    "data": "bpi.EUR.rate",
                    "context": "In Euros: {{BTC Price USD}} EUR"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
```

<ParamField body="dynamic_data[i].response_data" type="array">
An array of objects describing how to parse and use the data fetched from the API.

Each object in this array should contain:

- `name`: A label for the fetched data.
- Example: `"Flight Status"`
- `data`: The JSON path in the API response to extract the data from.
- Example: `"user.flights[0].status"`
- `context`: How this data should be incorporated into the AI's knowledge.
- Example: `"John's flight is currently {{Flight Status}}"`
    </ParamField>
   </Expandable>
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="interruption_threshold" type="integer" default={50}>
  When you increase the interruption latency, you force the AI phone agent to listen longer before responding. In practice, increasing the threshold results in less interruptions and more latency.

Try setting the threshold to `500` milliseconds. You'll encounter higher latency, but you'll be interrupted much less frequently.

</ParamField>

### Response

<ResponseField name="status" type="string">
  Can be `success` or `error`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="call_id" type="string">
  A unique identifier for the call (present only if status is `success`).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseExample>

```json Response
{
  "status": "success",
  "call_id": "9d404c1b-6a23-4426-953a-a52c392ff8f1"
}
```
