### Headers

<ParamField header="authorization" type="string" required>
  Your API key for authentication.
</ParamField>

### Path Parameters

<ParamField path="call_id" type="string" required>
  The unique identifier for the call to be analyzed.
</ParamField>

### Request Body

<ParamField body="goal" type="string" required>
  This is the overall purpose of the call. Provides context for the analysis to guide how the questions/transcripts are
  interpreted.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="questions" type="array" required>
  An array of questions to be analyzed for the call. 
  
  Each question should be an array with two elements: the question text and the expected answer type (e.g., "string", "boolean").

Fairly flexible in terms of the expected answer type, and unanswerable questions will default to `null`.

Examples:

```json
"questions": [
      ["Who answered the call?", "human or voicemail"],
      ["Positive feedback about the product: ", "string"],
      ["Negative feedback about the product: ", "string"],
      ["Customer confirmed they were satisfied", "boolean"]
  ]
```

</ParamField>

### Response

<ResponseField type="object" name="status">
  Will be `success` if the request was successful.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField type="string" name="message">
  Confirms the request was successful, or provides an error message if the request failed.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField type="array" name="answers">
  Contains the analyzed answers for the call in an array.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField type="number" name="credits_used">
  Token-based price for the analysis request.

As a rough estimate, the base cost is `0.003` credits with an additional `0.0015` credits per call in the call.

Longer call transcripts and higher numbers of questions can increase the cost, however the cost scales very effectively with calls vs. individual calls.

</ResponseField>

<ResponseExample>
```json
{
    "status": "success",
    "message": "Successfully analyzed call",
    "answers": [
        "human",
        "Customer found the product sturdy and reliable",
        "A bit heavy",
        true
    ]
}
```
</ResponseExample>
