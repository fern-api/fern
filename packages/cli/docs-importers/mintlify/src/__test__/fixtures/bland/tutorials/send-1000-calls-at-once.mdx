## Step 1: Setup Your Authorization

To initiate a batch call, you must first authenticate your request. Ensure you have your API key from signing up on the [developer portal](https://app.bland.ai).

## Step 2: Create the Base Prompt

Craft a base prompt that will be common across all calls in the batch. Use placeholders `{{curly braces}}` for dynamic content.

Example:

```javascript
"You are calling {{business}} to renew their subscription to {{service}} before it expires on {{date}}.";
```

## Step 3: Define the Call Data

Specify the list of calls in the `call_data` array. Each call must have a `phone_number` and can include other properties corresponding to placeholders in your base prompt.

Example:

```javascript
[
  {
    phone_number: "1234567890",
    business: "ABC co.",
    service: "Netflix",
    date: "September 4th",
  },
  {
    phone_number: "32176540987",
    business: "XYZ inc.",
    service: "Window Cleaning",
    date: "December 20th",
  },
];
```

## Step 4: Additional Configuration

- `label`: Assign a label to your batch for easy tracking.
- `campaign_id`: Organize related batches under a campaign.
- `test_mode`: Set to true for testing with the first call only.
- `batch_id`: Manually set or auto-generated for tracking.
- Voice and Language Settings: Select `voice_id`, `reduce_latency`, and `language`.
- `request_data`: Include specific facts for the AI to know during the call.
- `webook`: For real-time notifications and transcripts post-call.
- `max_duration`: Define the maximum length of each call.
- `amd`: Enable for navigating phone trees or leaving voicemails.
- `wait_for_greeting`: Control if the AI speaks immediately or waits.

## Step 5: Send the API Request

Use the provided JavaScript or Python code snippet to make the API request.

## Step 6: Handle the Response

After sending the batch request, you'll receive a response with a `message` and the `batch_id`. Monitor the progress of your calls and any responses via your specified webhook.

Here's what an example response might look like:

```javascript
{
  "message": "success",
  "batch_id": "3p$7rQ3p9sT5bzmF-gen-batch"
}
```

## Step 7: Monitoring and Analytics

Track the performance and outcomes of your batch calls through the provided `batch_id` and campaign analytics. Adjust future batches based on the insights gained.
