</ParamField>
### Body

<ParamField body="phone_number" type="string" required>
  The phone number to call. Country code defaults to `+1` (US) if not specified. 
  
  Formatting is flexible, however for the most predictable results use the [E.164](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-e164#examples-of-e164-numbers) format.

    <Accordion title="Formatting Examples">
        Expected/Ideal Format:
        - "+12223334444"
        - "+91223334444"
        - "+61223334444"

        Valid, but not recommended:
        - "2223334444"
        - "+1 (222) 333-4444"
        - "+1 222 333 4444"
        - "222-333-4444"

        Invalid:
        - "12223334444"
        - "552223334444"
        - "non-numeric characters"
        - "2223334444 ext. 123"
    </Accordion>

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="task" type="string" required>
  Provide instructions, relevant information, and examples of the ideal conversation flow.

    <Accordion title="Best Practices">
        #### Out-of-the-Box Behaviors (Summarized):
        - Speech pattern: Direct, concise, casual
        - Spells out symbols, acronyms, abbreviations, percentages, etc. ($4,000,000 -> "four million dollars")
        - Asks clarifying questions
        - Ends call when objective is complete or voicemail is detected

        #### Prompting Tips:
        - Want to easily test out exactly how your agent will behave?
            - [Try out Agent Testing!](https://app.bland.ai/home?page=testing)
        - Aim for less than >2,000 characters where possible.
        - Simple, direct prompts are the most predictable and reliable.
        - Frame instructions positively:
            - `"Do this"` rather than `"Don't do this"`.
            - Ex. "Keep the conversation casual" rather than "Don't be too formal".
            - This gives concrete examples of what to do, instead of leaving expected behavior open to interpretation.
