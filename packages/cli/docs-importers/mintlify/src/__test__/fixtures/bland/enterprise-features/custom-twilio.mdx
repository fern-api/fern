## Overview

Enterprise customers can connect their own Twilio account to Bland. Easily bring over your existing phone numbers, integrations, and more.

Pre-requisites:

- Your own Twilio account
- An [Enterprise plan](https://forms.default.com/361589) with Bland

## Step 1: Creating an Encrypted Key with your Twilio Credentials

1. Go to your [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console) and get your Account SID and Auth Token.
2. Create an `encrypted_key` by [sending an API request](/api-v1/post/accounts) to Bland.

This is the only time that your `encrypted_key` will be returned to you. Make sure to store it securely, and new keys will need to be generated if lost.

## Step 2: Using the Encrypted Key in Outbound Calls

Include `encrypted_key` in the headers (in addition to the `Authorization` header) of your API requests, and we'll use that account's credentials to make the call.

For example:

```json
{
  "Authorization": "BLAND_API_KEY",
  "encrypted_key": "YOUR_ENCRYPTED_KEY"
}
```

Note:

- You can set your `from` number in the API request - this will need to be a number owned by that Twilio account (and not one purchased through Bland).
- By default, we'll send calls from a randomly selected number in the specified Twilio account if a `from` is not specified.

## Step 3: Uploading Inbound numbers

1. Go to your [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console) and get your Twilio phone number(s).
2. Upload your numbers [through the API](/api-v1/post/inbound-insert).

We'll validate that these numbers are owned by that account and add them to your Bland account.

## Step 4: Configuring Inbound Numbers/Webhooks

Note: When updating inbound numbers, the headers need to include the `encrypted_key` in addition to the `Authorization` header. Doing so makes sure the updates are applied to the correct Twilio account.

Once you update an inbound number through the [Dev Portal](https://app.bland.ai) or [API](/api-v1/post/inbound-number-update), that number will be automatically configured to run on Bland's infrastructure. No additional steps are required!
