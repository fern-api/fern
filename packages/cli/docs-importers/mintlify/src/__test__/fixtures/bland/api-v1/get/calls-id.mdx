</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="c_id" type="number">
  The unique identifier for the call.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="variables" type="object">
  Variables created during the call - both system variables as well as generated with `dynamic_data`.

For example, if you used a `dynamic_data` API request to generate a variable called `appointment_time`, you would see it here.

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="concatenated_transcript" type="string">
  A single string containing all of the text from the call. Excludes system messages and auto-generated data.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="to" type="string">
  The phone number that received the call.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="from" type="string">
  The phone number that made the call.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="batch_id" type="string">
  If the call is part of a batch, it's `batch_id` will be here.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="request_data" type="object">
  Details about parameters in the original api request.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="completed" type="boolean">
  Whether the call has been completed. If it differs from the value of 'queue_status', this will be the most up-to-date
  status.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="queue_status" type="string">
  The status of the call. During extremely high volume periods, calls may be queued for a short period of time before being dispatched.

Progresses through the following stages:

- `new`: An API request has been received.
- `queued`: Call pararameters have been validated and authentication succeeded.
- `allocated`: Extremely brief, the call is being dispatched.
- `started`: The phone call is live and in progress.
- `complete`: The phone call has ended successfully.

The following statuses show the point that was reached before an error:

- `pre_queue_error`: An error occurred before the call was queued. Invalid parameters generally cause this.
- `queue_error`: Error occurred while the call was queued. Ex. Valid phone number but to an unserviced area.
- `call_error`: Error occurred during live call. May be caused by transferring to an invalid phone number or an unforeseen error.
- `complete_error`: Error occurred after the call was completed. Ex. A post-call webhook failed.

If at any point an error occurs, it will be recorded in the `error_message` field.

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="error_message" type="string or null">
  If an error occurs, this will contain a description of the error. Otherwise, it will be null.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="answered_by" type="string">
  If `answered_by_enabled` was set to `true` in the original API request, this field contains one of the following values:

- `human`: The call was answered by a human.
- `voicemail`: The call was answered by an answering machine or voicemail.
- `unknown`: There was not enough audio at the start of the call to make a determination.
- `no-answer`: The call was not answered.
- `null`: Not enabled, or still processing the result.

        <Accordion title="Notes:">

  - Determinations are based on audio from the first five seconds of the phone call.
  - `unknown` is most likely a human, especially if there are multiple transcripts.
  - Optimize calls for accurate results by getting humans to respond in the first five seconds: - Increase `speed` in `voice_settings` - Use with `wait_for_greeting` - Use a short greeting in `first_sentence` such as "Hello?" or "Hi, is this \{\{name\}\}?"
    </Accordion>
    </ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="endpoint_url" type="string">
  The URL that was called to dispatch the phone call.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="max_duration" type="number">
  The maximum length of time the call was allowed to last. If the call would exceed this length, it's ended early.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="corrected_duration" type="number">
  The total length of time the call was connected. This differs from call_length in that it includes ringing and
  connection time.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="call_length" type="number">
  The length of the call in minutes.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="created_at" type="string">
  The timestamp for when the call was dispatched.
</ResponseField>
