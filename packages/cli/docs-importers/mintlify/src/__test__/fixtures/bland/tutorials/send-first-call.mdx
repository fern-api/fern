## Step 1: Setup Your Authorization

Before making a call, you need to authenticate your request. Make sure you have your API key ready.

Sign up on the [developer portal](https://app.bland.ai) to get yours.

## Step 2: Prepare the Call Data

You will need to provide specific details for the call. These include:

- `phone_number`: The number you want to call. Remember to include the country code.
- `task`: Describe the purpose of the call and how the AI should handle the conversation.
- `voice_id`: Choose the voice persona (American male, Australian female, etc.) based on your preference.
- Set parameters like `reduce_latency`, `record`, `amd` (for navigating phone trees), and `wait_for_greeting` according to your call's requirements.

## Step 3: Customize the Call

You can further personalize the call by:

1. Setting a `first_sentence` for the call.
2. Specifying `dynamic_data` to incorporate external API data.
3. Adjusting `voice_settings` for stability, similarity, and speed.
4. Choosing the language with the `language` parameter.
5. Setting a `max_duration` for the call.

## Step 4: Send the API Request

Use the provided JavaScript or Python code snippet to make the API request.

## Step 5: Handle the Response

After the call, you will receive a response with the `status` and `call_id`. If you set `record` to true, you can retrieve the recording using the `/call/recording` endpoint.

Here's what an example response might look like:

```javascript
{
  "status": "success",
  "call_id": "9d404c1b-6a23-4426-953a-a52c392ff8f1"
}
```

## Step 6: Monitor the Call

If you have set up a webhook, you will receive real-time notifications and transcripts once the call completes.

And that's it! You're now ready to make your first AI-powered phone call with Bland AI. Happy calling!
