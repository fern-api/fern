### Headers

<ParamField header="authorization" type="string" required>
  Your API key for authentication.
</ParamField>

### Body

<ParamField body="call_id" type="string" required>
  The unique identifier for the call.
</ParamField>

### Response

<ResponseField name="transcripts" type="array of objects">
  An array of phrases spoken during the call. Each index includes: - `id` - `created_at` - `text` - `user` (can be
  `user`, `assistant`, `robot`, or `agent-action`)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="c_id" type="number">
  The unique identifier for the call.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="to" type="string">
  The phone number that received the call.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="from" type="string">
  The phone number that made the call.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="request_data" type="object">
  Details about parameters in the original api request.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="completed" type="boolean">
  Whether the call has been completed. If it differs from the value of 'queue_status', this will be the most up-to-date
  status.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="queue_status" type="string">
  The status of the call. During extremely high volume periods, calls may be queued for a short period of time before being dispatched.

Progresses through the following stages:

- `new`: An API request has been received.
- `queued`: Call pararameters have been validated and authentication succeeded.
- `allocated`: Extremely brief, the call is being dispatched.
- `started`: The phone call is live and in progress.
- `complete`: The phone call has ended successfully.

The following statuses show the point that was reached before an error:

- `pre_queue_error`: An error occurred before the call was queued. Invalid parameters generally cause this.
- `queue_error`: Error occurred while the call was queued. Ex. Valid phone number but to an unserviced area.
- `call_error`: Error occurred during live call. May be caused by transferring to an invalid phone number or an unforeseen error.
- `complete_error`: Error occurred after the call was completed. Ex. A post-call webhook failed.

If at any point an error occurs, it will be recorded in the `error_message` field.

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="error_message" type="string or null">
  If an error occurs, this will contain a description of the error. Otherwise, it will be null.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="endpoint_url" type="string">
  The URL that was called to dispatch the phone call.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="max_duration" type="number">
  The maximum length of time the call was allowed to last. If the call would exceed this length, it's ended early.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="corrected_duration" type="number">
  The total length of time the call was connected. This differs from call_length in that it includes ringing and
  connection time.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="call_length" type="number">
  The length of the call in minutes. Only counts connected time.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="created_at" type="string">
  The timestamp for when the call was dispatched.
</ResponseField>

# Polling example

To track the status of a live phone call, you can use a 'polling' technique to repeatedly ping the logs endpoint.

Here's an example in Javascript and Python.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript PollLogs.js
const axios = require('axios');

// Headers
const headers = {
'authorization': 'YOUR-API-KEY-HERE'
};

// Data
const data = {
call_id: "YOUR-CALL-ID",
};

// Function to make the API request
const makeRequest = async () => {
try {
const response = await axios.post("https://api.bland.ai/logs", data, { headers });
console.log("Success:", response.data);
} catch (error) {
console.error("Failed:", error);
}
};

// Ping the endpoint every 2 seconds (2000 milliseconds)
setInterval(makeRequest, 2000);

````

```python PollLogs.py
import requests
import time

def make_request():
    headers = {'authorization': 'YOUR-API-KEY-HERE'}
    data = {'call_id': 'YOUR-CALL-ID'}
    try:
        response = requests.post('https://api.bland.ai/logs', json=data, headers=headers)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            print(f"Success: {response.json()}")
        else:
            print(f"Failed: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Exception: {e}")

# Ping the endpoint every 2 seconds
while True:
    make_request()
    time.sleep(2)
````
