### Body

<ParamField body="prompt" type="string" required>
    Provide instructions, relevant information, and examples of the ideal conversation flow.

    For inbound numbers, consider including additional context about the purpose of the call, and what types of callers to expect.

    <Accordion title="Best Practices">
        #### Out-of-the-Box Behaviors (Summarized):
        - Speech pattern: Direct, concise, casual
        - Spells out symbols, acronyms, abbreviations, percentages, etc. ($4,000,000 -> "four million dollars")
        - Asks clarifying questions

        #### Prompting Tips:
        - Want to easily test out exactly how your agent will behave?
            - [Try out Agent Testing!](https://app.bland.ai/home?page=testing)
        - Aim for less than >2,000 characters where possible.
        - Simple, direct prompts are the most predictable and reliable.
        - Frame instructions positively:
            - `"Do this"` rather than `"Don't do this"`.
            - Ex. "Keep the conversation casual" rather than "Don't be too formal".
            - This gives concrete examples of what to do, instead of leaving expected behavior open to interpretation.
    </Accordion>

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="voice" type="string">
  Set your agent's voice - all available voices can be found with the [List Voices](/api-v1/get/voices) endpoint.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="analysis_schema" type="object">
  Define a JSON schema for how you want to get information about the call - information like email addresses, names, appointment times or any other type of custom data.

In the webhook response or whenever you retrieve call data later, you'll get the data you defined back under `analysis`.

For example, if you wanted to retrieve this information from the call:

```json
"analysis_schema": {
  "email_address": "email",
  "first_name": "string",
  "last_name": "string",
  "wants_to_book_appointment": "boolean",
  "appointment_time": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
}
```

You would get it filled out like this in your webhook once the call completes:

```json
"analysis": {
  "email_address": "johndoe@gmail.com",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "wants_to_book_appointment": true,
  "appointment_time": "2024-01-01 12:00:00"
}
```

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="metadata" type="object">
  Add any additional information you want to associate with the call. This can be useful for tracking or categorizing
  calls.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="pathway_id" type="string">
    Set the pathway that your agent will follow. This will override the `prompt` field, so there is no need to pass the 'prompt' field if you are setting a pathway.

    Warning: Setting a pathway will set the following fields to `null` / their default value - `prompt`, `first_sentence`, `model`, `dynamic_data`, `tools`

    Set to `null` or an empty string to clear the pathway.

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="language" type="string" default="ENG">
  Select a supported language of your choice. Optimizes every part of our API for that language - transcription, speech,
  and other inner workings. Supported Languages and their codes: - English: ```ENG``` - Spanish: ```ESP``` - French:
  ```FRE``` - Polish: ```POL``` - German: ```GER``` - Italian: ```ITA``` - Brazilian Portuguese: ```PBR``` - Portuguese:
  ```POR```
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="webhook" type="string">
  The webhook should be a http / https callback url. We will send the call_id
  and transcript to this URL after the call completes. This can be useful if you
  want to have real time notifications when calls finish.

Set to `null` or an empty string to clear the webhook.

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="transfer_list" type="object">
  Give your agent the ability to transfer calls to a set of phone numbers.

Overrides `transfer_phone_number` if a `transfer_list.default` is specified.

Will default to `transfer_list.default`, or the chosen phone number.

Example usage to route calls to different departments:

```json
"transfer_list": {
    "default": "+12223334444",
    "sales": "+12223334444",
    "support": "+12223334444",
    "billing": "+12223334444"
}
```

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="model" type="string" default="enhanced">
  Select a model to use for your call.

Options: `base`, `turbo` and `enhanced`.

In nearly all cases, `enhanced` is the best choice for now.

  <Accordion title="Model Differences">

There are three different ways to use Bland:

- `model: base`

  - The original, follows scripts/procedures most effectively.
  - Supports all features and capabilities.
  - Best for Custom Tools

- `model: enhanced`

  - Much faster latency and very conversational, works best with objective-based prompts.
  - Supports all features and capabilities.

- `model: turbo`

  - The absolute fastest latency possible, can be verbose at times
  - Limited capabilities currently (excludes Transferring, IVR navigation, Custom Tools)
  - Extremely realistic conversation capabilities

        </Accordion>

    </ParamField>

<ParamField body="transfer_phone_number" type="string">
  A phone number that the agent can transfer to under specific conditions - such as being asked to speak to a human or supervisor.

Set to `null` to remove.

    <Accordion title="Prompting Notes">
        For best results:
        - Specify conditions that the agent should transfer to a human under (examples are great!)
        - In the `task`, refer to the action solely as "transfer" or "transferring".
        - Alternate phrasing such as "swap" or "switch" can mislead the agent, causing the action to be ignored.
    </Accordion>

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="record" type="boolean" default="false">
  To record your phone call, set `record` to true. When your call completes, you can access through the `recording_url`
  field in the call details or your webhook.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="first_sentence" type="string">
  A phrase that your call will start with instead of a generating one on the fly. This works both with and without `wait_for_greeting`. Can be more than one sentence, but must be less than 200 characters.

To remove, set to `null` or an empty string.

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="tools" type="array">
  Interact with the real world through API calls.

Detailed tutorial here: [Custom Tools](/tutorials/custom-tools)

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="dynamic_data" type="object">
  Integrate data from external APIs into your agent's knowledge.

Set to `null` or an empty string to clear dynamic data settings.

Detailed usage in the [Send Call](/api-v1/post/calls) endpoint.

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="interruption_threshold" type="integer (milliseconds)" default={50}>
  When you increase the interruption latency, you force the AI phone agent to listen longer before responding. In practice, increasing the threshold results in less interruptions and more latency.

Try setting the threshold to `500` milliseconds. You'll encounter higher latency, but you'll be interrupted less frequently.

Set to `null` to reset to default.

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="max_duration" type="integer (minutes)" default={30}>
  The maximum duration that calls to your agent can last before being automatically terminated.

Set to `null` to reset to default.

</ParamField>
