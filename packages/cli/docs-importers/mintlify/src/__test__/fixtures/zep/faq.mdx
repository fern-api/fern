    interested in a specific language.

<Accordion title="What is the relationship between Zep Cloud and Zep Open Source?">
    Zep Cloud is currently a major update to the Zep Open Source product. Going forward, Zep Open Source will offer a
    subset of Zep Cloud's functionality, primarily as proprietary language models are used exclusively in Zep Cloud.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Will you be updating Zep Open Source?">
    Yes - we will be releasing a new version of Zep Open Source based on Zep Cloud functionality.
