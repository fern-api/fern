### Client credentials

Layer uses OAuth2's client credentials flow to authenticate API clients. To start your development, we will give you a set of `client_id` and `client_secret` tokens. 

<Info>
  To obtain a set of client credentials, reach out to our team [here](https://layerfi.com/#contact-form).

### Getting a bearer token
Calls to the Layer API require a bearer access token. To receive an access token and make calls to other API endpoints, provide your `client_id` and `client_secret` in the body of a POST request to Layer’s authorization server as shown below.

```bash
curl -X POST https://auth.layerfi.com/oauth2/token  \
  -u <client_id>:<client_secret>  \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  --data-urlencode "grant_type=client_credentials" \
  --data-urlencode "scope=https://sandbox.layerfi.com/sandbox" \
  --data-urlencode "client_id=<client_id>"
```

The authorization server will respond with your granted access token.

```json
{
  "access_token": "<access_token>",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

### Making authenticated API calls

Use the access token in requests to the API by including it as a Bearer token in the authorization header.

```bash
curl https://sandbox.layerfi.com/whoami \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>" 
```

Access tokens expire after 1 hour. To refresh your access token, make another call to Layer’s authorization endpoint with your `client_id` and `client_secret`. We recommend refreshing tokens for new sets of requests rather than persisting access tokens.
