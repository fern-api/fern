The Layer API provides access to Layer's embeddable accounting software. Using the API, you can seamlessly pass your customers' financial data into Layer's accounting software and surface a complete SMB accounting product within your platform.

## API Environments

The Layer API has two environments:
- **Sandbox:** `sandbox.layerfi.com` - Test environment for building your integration with Layer.
- **Production:** `api.layerfi.com` - Production environment for live usage with your SMB customers.

## Getting an API key

The first step to getting started is to contact us to obtain an API key. We will first send you a sandbox API key to use during development. Once you feel ready to go live and we review your integration, we'll provide your production API key.

To obtain your API key and get started, reach out to our team [here](https://layerfi.com/#contact-form).
