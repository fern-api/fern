Layer provides a full set of accounting charts and table reports that you can embed directly within your platform. You can use these reports to give your customers a clear picture of their business profitability, cash flows, and balance sheet.

There are two ways to offer reporting within your platform:
* **Embedded UI components** - Embed Layer's charts and report UI components within your experience.
* **API** - Call Layer's API directly to build your own accounting reports.


## Embedded components
Layer provides a variety of chart and table report UI components that you can download via npm and embed directly within your frontend. Below are some examples:

**Profit & Loss chart**

More detail on using Layer's embedded UI components is available [here](/guides/embedded-components). Reach out to your Layer contact for a full list of embedded reporting components.

## API

### Retrieving a Profit & Loss report
To build your own Profit & Loss report UI make a call to the [retrieve a Profit and Loss Report](/api-reference/get-profit-and-loss-report-for-business) endpoint.

<Note>The start_date query string parameter is required for all calls to the Retrieve a Profit and Loss Report endpoint.</Note>


```bash Request
curl -X GET https://sandbox.layerfi.com/v1/businesses/:business_id/reports/profit-and-loss?start_date=2023-01-01T00:00:00-06:00&end_date=2023-12-01T00:00:00-06:00 
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>"
```

The API will respond with the generated [Profit and Loss Report](/api-reference/pnl).
