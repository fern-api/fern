Users often respond to questions with single-word answers that don't offer much information for search.
For example, a user may respond to a question about their favorite book with "Dune" or a question about their
dietary restrictions with "dairy".

<Info>
  Without context, many user messages lack information necessary to successfully embed a search query, resulting in poor
  or irrelevant search results.

Zep provides a low-latency question synthesis API that can be used to generate a question from the current conversation context, using
the most recent message to center the question. The resulting question can be used to search over document Collections or
chat history Messages and Summaries.

Zep's [Perpetual Memory](/chat-history-memory) uses this question synthesis functionality internally to ensure
that Memories it returns are relevant and useful.

While it's possible to synthesize a question using a general purpose LLM, this is often a slow and inaccurate exercise.
Zep's private, fine-tuned models are designed to return results in hundreds of milliseconds.
