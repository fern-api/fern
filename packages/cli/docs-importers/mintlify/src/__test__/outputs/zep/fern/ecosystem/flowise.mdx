## Using Zep Cloud Nodes

Once you have Flowise app up and running, you can use Zep Cloud nodes in your LLM apps.

We expose the following nodes:

- `Zep Memory - Cloud` - wrapper around Zep Memory API. You can use this node to add Long-Term memory to your app.

In order to use this node, you will need to have a Zep Project API key and add it as a Connect Credential in your Flowise app.

A complete chain using Zep Memory Node, may look like this:

- `Zep Collection - Cloud` - wrapper around Zepâ€™s document vector store. It lets you embed and search documents. You can use this node to add RAG capabilities to your app.

In order to use this node, you will need to have a Zep Project API key and add it as a Connect Credential in your Flowise app.

You will also need to provide the collection name for your Zep Collection.

<Note>
    Note that we are using a Website Crawler node to load documents about **Marie Curie** into a **Zep Collection**.
    You can also connect any other Document Loader available on Flowise platform.

    We are using **Zep Collection Node** as a retriever passed into **Conversational Retrieval QA Chain**.

    This example also illustrates how you can use **Zep Memory** in combination with **Zep Collection**.
