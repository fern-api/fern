A summary for the last or trailing `N` messages is generated on every new message added to a Session. `N` is the
configured
`Message Window` for your [Zep Project](/getting-started/projects). The first summary is generated after the first `N` messages are
added to a Session.

<Note>
**Summaries are generated asynchronously.**

Zep uses a proprietary, low-latency summarization model to generate dialog summaries asynchronously. This means that
summary generation does not delay your requests to retrieve Memories from Zep.

## Accessing Summaries

Summaries are added to Memory responses when you retrieve a Session's [Memory](memories), enabling your prompt to be
populated with both the most recent messages and a summary the more distant history.

### Perpetual Memory

Zep searches for summaries relevant to the current conversation, summaries high-scoring summaries that are returned from
search and includes this summary in your Memory request.

### Message Window Buffer Memory

Zep automatically determines which summary to add to a response based on your configured `Message Window` and the number
of messages in the Session.
