Bland is a platform for AI phone calling. Using our API, you can easily send or receive phone calls with a programmable voice agent.

We really care about making our phone calls...

1. **Fast**: sub-second latency from person speaking to AI responding.
2. **Reliable**: it's our responsibility, day in and day out, to make sure your phone calls work. No exceptions.
3. **Ultra flexible**: configure all aspects of your agent's behavior, by settings it's voice, creating transfer scenarios, configuring the initial greeting, etc.
