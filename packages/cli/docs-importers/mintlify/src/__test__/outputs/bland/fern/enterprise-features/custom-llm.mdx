## Background on fine-tuning

Traditionally, most AI phone agents use private models from companies like OpenAI and Anthropic. Those LLMs are large, and perform best at following instructions and delivering high quality outputs. The downside, however, is they are very slow. Additionally, because they're general models, their personality, tone, and overall capabilities are limited.

Conversely, open source models generally perform worse at a broad range of tasks. However, by fine-tuning an open-source model with examples of a given task, you can significantly improve it's performance at that task, even surpassing the capabilties of top-of-the-line models like GPT-4.
