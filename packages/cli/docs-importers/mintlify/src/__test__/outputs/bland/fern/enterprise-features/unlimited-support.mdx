Bland enterprise customers receive access to a shared slack channel with Bland's engineering team and founders. Enterprise customers also receive the founders phone numbers. Finally, for enterprise customers, the team strives to respond to every message in under five minutes, while maintaining a 24-hour SLA.

Bland's engineers will guide on:

1. Using features like `dynamic_data` and `custom_tools`
2. Best practices for prompting & configuring the phone agent
3. Making customizations (e.g. bring your own twilio, custom languages & voices, etc.)
