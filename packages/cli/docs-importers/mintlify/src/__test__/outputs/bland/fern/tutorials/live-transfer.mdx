## Introduction

Implementing live transfer in your AI-powered phone calls enhances flexibility and customer experience. This guide will explain how to set up a live transfer during a call using Bland AI.

## Step 1: Understand Live Transfer

Live transfer allows the AI agent to transfer the call to a human representative under certain conditions. This is crucial for scenarios where human intervention is preferred.

## Step 2: Setup Your Authorization

Before initiating a live transfer, ensure your API key is ready. Obtain your key from the [developer portal](https://app.bland.ai) if you haven't already.

## Step 3: Configure the Transfer Settings

Include the `transfer_phone_number` parameter in your call data. This is the number the AI will transfer to. Additionally, define the conditions for transfer in the task parameter.

Example:

```javascript
{
    "phone_number": "+11233456789",
    "transfer_phone_number": "+19876543210",
    "task": "If the caller requests to speak with a human, transfer the call to the representative."
}
```

## Step 4: Send the API Request

Make the API request using the JavaScript or Python code snippet provided, ensuring the `transfer_phone_number` and conditions are included.

## Step 5: Test and Monitor

After setting up the live transfer, test the functionality to ensure it works as expected. Monitor the calls to adjust the transfer conditions as necessary.

## Conclusion

Setting up a live transfer offers a seamless experience for situations where AI needs to hand over to a human. You're now ready to integrate this feature into your AI-powered calls with Bland AI.

Maintain a balance between automated and human interactions to optimize customer satisfaction. Happy calling!
