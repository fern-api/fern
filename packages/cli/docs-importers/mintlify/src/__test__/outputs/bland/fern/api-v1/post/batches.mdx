### Headers

<ParamField header="authorization" type="string" required>
  Your API key for authentication.
</ParamField>

### Body

<ParamField body="base_prompt" type="string" required>
  This is the prompt or task used for all the phone calls in the request. Information can be inserted into it surrounding variable names with \{\{curly braces\}\}.

Example:

```json
"You are calling {{business}} to renew their subscription to {{service}} before it expires on {{date}}."
```

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="call_data" type="array" required>
  Define a list of calls to make and their properties. Each call in call_data MUST have a "phone_number" property. Properties are case-sensitive.

Example:

```json
[
  {
    "phone_number": "1234567890",
    "business": "ABC Corp",
    "service": "Netflix",
    "date": "September 4th"
  },
  {
    "phone_number": "32176540987",
    "business": "XYZ inc.",
    "service": "Window Cleaning",
    "date": "December 20th"
  }
]
```

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="label" type="string">
  Adds a user-friendly label to your batch to keep track of it's original intention. This can help differentiate
  multiple call batches that are part of the same Campaign. Shown when a batch is retreived.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="campaign_id" type="string">
  Use ```campaign_id``` to organize related batches together. This can be set manually or auto-generated through
  Campaigns.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="test_mode" type="boolean" default="false">
  When this is set to ```true```, only the first call of ```call_data``` will be dispatched. A common use case is to set the first ```phone_number``` value to your own to confirm everything's set up properly.

Includes additional information in the response when true so that it's easier to find any issues.

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="*">
  All other parameters supported by the [Send Call](/api-v1/post/calls) endpoint are supported here as well. They will
  be applied to each call in the batch.
</ParamField>

### Response

  If anything other than "success" is returned, there was an error.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="batch_id" type="string">
  The unique identifier for the batch.
</ResponseField>
