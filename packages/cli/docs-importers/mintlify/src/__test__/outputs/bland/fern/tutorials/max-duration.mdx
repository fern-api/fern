## Introduction

Controlling the length of your AI-powered phone calls is crucial for efficiency and cost-effectiveness. In this guide, we'll walk you through how to set a `max_duration` for your calls using Bland AI.

## Step 1: Understand max_duration

The `max_duration` parameter allows you to specify the longest duration you want your call to last, measured in minutes. Once the set duration is reached, the call will automatically end.

## Step 2: Setup Your Authorization

Ensure you have your API key ready for authentication. If you haven't obtained one, sign up on the [developer portal](app.bland.ai).

## Step 3: Define max_duration in Your Call Data

When preparing your call data, include the `max_duration` parameter. You can set it as a float or a string.

Example values: `"30", "5.5", 45, 2.8`.

Hereâ€™s how you might include it in your request data:

```javascript
{
    "phone_number": "+11233456789",
    "task": "Inquire about the latest product updates.",
    "max_duration": "10", // Call lasts for 10 minutes max
}
```

## Step 4: Send the API Request

Use the provided JavaScript or Python code snippet to make the API request, ensuring you include the `max_duration` parameter.

## Step 5: Test and Adjust

After setting `max_duration`, test your calls to ensure they're ending at the desired time. Adjust as necessary based on your needs and feedback.

## Conclusion

Setting a `max_duration` for your calls ensures they are concise and to the point, saving time and resources. You're now ready to efficiently manage the length of your AI-powered calls with Bland AI.

Remember, the key is to find the right balance between giving enough time for meaningful interaction and keeping the calls concise. Happy calling!
