Bland webhooks are signed with a secret key to ensure that they are not tampered with in transit and to confirm that they were sent by Bland.

## Signing Webhooks

When Bland sends a webhook, it calculates a signature using the HMAC algorithm with the SHA-256 hash function. The signature is then included in the `X-Webhook-Signature` header of the request.

To create a webhook signing secret, first go to the [Account Settings in the Dev Portal](https://app.bland.ai/dashboard?page=settings) and click on the "Keys" tab.

Here you can create a new secret by clicking "Replace Secret". It will only be shown once, so save it securely.

## Verifying Webhooks

To verify a webhook, you need to calculate the HMAC signature of the request body using the secret key and compare it to the signature in the `X-Webhook-Signature` header.

Note that you must first create a webhook signing secret in the [Account Settings in the Dev Portal](https://app.bland.ai/dashboard?page=settings).

Here is an example of how to verify a webhook in Node.js:

```javascript
const crypto = require("node:crypto");

function verifyWebhookSignature(key, data, signature) {
  const expectedSignature = crypto.createHmac("sha256", key).update(data).digest("hex");

  return expectedSignature === signature;
}

//...

app.post("/webhook", (req, res) => {
  const isValid = verifyWebhookSignature(
    process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET,
    JSON.stringify(req.body),
    req.headers["x-webhook-signature"],
  );

  //...
});
```
