      socket_sequence:
        docs: >-
          zero-indexed monotonic increasing sequence number attached to each
          message sent - if there is a gap in this sequence, you have missed a
          message. If you choose to enable heartbeats, then heartbeat and update
          messages will share a single increasing sequence. See [Sequence
          Numbers](https://docs.sandbox.gemini.com/websocket-api/#sequence-numbers)
          for more information.
