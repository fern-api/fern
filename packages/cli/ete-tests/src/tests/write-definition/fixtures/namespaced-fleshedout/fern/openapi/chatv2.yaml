        schema:
          type: object

            model:
              type: string
              description: The name of a compatible [Cohere model](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/models) (such as command-r or command-r-plus) or the ID of a [fine-tuned](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/chat-fine-tuning) model.
            documents:
              type: array
              items:
                type: string
              description: |
                A list of relevant documents that the model can cite to generate a more accurate reply. Each document is either a string or document object with content and metadata.
            safety_mode:
              enum: [ 'CONTEXTUAL', 'STRICT', 'NONE' ]
              description: |
                Used to select the [safety instruction](/docs/safety-modes) inserted into the prompt. Defaults to `CONTEXTUAL`.
                When `NONE` is specified, the safety instruction will be omitted.

                Safety modes are not yet configurable in combination with `tools`, `tool_results` and `documents` parameters.

                **Note**: This parameter is only compatible with models [Command R 08-2024](/docs/command-r#august-2024-release), [Command R+ 08-2024](/docs/command-r-plus#august-2024-release) and newer.

            max_tokens:
              type: integer
              description: |
                The maximum number of tokens the model will generate as part of the response. Note: Setting a low value may result in incomplete generations.
            stop_sequences:
              type: array
              items:
                type: string
              description: |
                A list of up to 5 strings that the model will use to stop generation. If the model generates a string that matches any of the strings in the list, it will stop generating tokens and return the generated text up to that point not including the stop sequence.
            temperature:
              type: number
              format: float
              minimum: 0
              maximum: 1
              description: |
                Defaults to `0.3`.

                A non-negative float that tunes the degree of randomness in generation. Lower temperatures mean less random generations, and higher temperatures mean more random generations.

                Randomness can be further maximized by increasing the  value of the `p` parameter.
            return_prompt:
              type: boolean
              x-internal: true
              description: Whether to return the prompt in the response.
