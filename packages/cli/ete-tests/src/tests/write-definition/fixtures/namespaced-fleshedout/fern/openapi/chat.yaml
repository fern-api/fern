                Defaults to `command-r-plus-08-2024`.

                The name of a compatible [Cohere model](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/models) or the ID of a [fine-tuned](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/chat-fine-tuning) model.

            stream:
              description: |
                Defaults to `false`.

                When `true`, the response will be a JSON stream of events. The final event will contain the complete response, and will have an `event_type` of `"stream-end"`.

                Streaming is beneficial for user interfaces that render the contents of the response piece by piece, as it gets generated.

            preamble:
              description: |
                When specified, the default Cohere preamble will be replaced with the provided one. Preambles are a part of the prompt used to adjust the model's overall behavior and conversation style, and use the `SYSTEM` role.

                The `SYSTEM` role is also used for the contents of the optional `chat_history=` parameter. When used with the `chat_history=` parameter it adds content throughout a conversation. Conversely, when used with the `preamble=` parameter it adds content at the start of the conversation only.

              description: |
                A list of previous messages between the user and the model, giving the model conversational context for responding to the user's `message`.

                Each item represents a single message in the chat history, excluding the current user turn. It has two properties: `role` and `message`. The `role` identifies the sender (`CHATBOT`, `SYSTEM`, or `USER`), while the `message` contains the text content.

                The chat_history parameter should not be used for `SYSTEM` messages in most cases. Instead, to add a `SYSTEM` role message at the beginning of a conversation, the `preamble` parameter should be used.

                An alternative to `chat_history`.

                Providing a `conversation_id` creates or resumes a persisted conversation with the specified ID. The ID can be any non empty string.

              description: |
                Defaults to `AUTO` when `connectors` are specified and `OFF` in all other cases.

                Dictates how the prompt will be constructed.

                With `prompt_truncation` set to "AUTO", some elements from `chat_history` and `documents` will be dropped in an attempt to construct a prompt that fits within the model's context length limit. During this process the order of the documents and chat history will be changed and ranked by relevance.

                With `prompt_truncation` set to "AUTO_PRESERVE_ORDER", some elements from `chat_history` and `documents` will be dropped in an attempt to construct a prompt that fits within the model's context length limit. During this process the order of the documents and chat history will be preserved as they are inputted into the API.

                With `prompt_truncation` set to "OFF", no elements will be dropped. If the sum of the inputs exceeds the model's context length limit, a `TooManyTokens` error will be returned.

                Safety modes are not yet configurable in combination with `tools`, `tool_results` and `documents` parameters.
