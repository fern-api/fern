        Running `fern check` will now check to confirm that the generator versions you are running are compatible with your Fern CLI version.

        Each version of SDK generators depends on a version of a libary that is exported by the Fern CLI, and as a result, each generator has a minimum
        compatible version of the Fern CLI. As an example, if you were to run `fern check` while leveraging `fernapi/fern-python-sdk` version `2.0.0`, on CLI version `0.1.3`, you'd receive the following error:

        `The generator fernapi/fern-python-sdk requires CLI version 0.23.0-rc4 or later (current version: 0.1.3-rc0).`

        Indicating that you must upgrade your CLI in order to leverage the current generator.
      added:
        - Running `fern check` will now check to confirm that the generator versions you are running are compatible with your Fern CLI version.

        Fixes an issue introduced in `0.41.1` that ignored server urls for docs generation.
      type: fix
    - summary: |
        Adds a `auth-schemes` and `auth` block where you can override auth for an existing spec.
        See below:

        ```generators.yml
        auth-schemes:
          Oauth:
            scheme: oauth
            type: client-credentials
            get-token:
              endpoint: auth.get-token
        api:
          auth: Oauth # overrides auth scheme
          specs:
            - openapi: path/to/openapi
        ```

        Adds a V2 configuration for the `api` block that is more flexible and allows
        OpenAPI users to consume Fern Definition features.

        For example, now you can override environments directly in the api configuration:
        ```yml
        api:
          environments:
            Production: https://prod.com
            Staging: https://staging.com
          specs:
            - openapi: path/to/openapi
              overrides: path/to/overrides
        ```

        If you want to define, multi-url environments, those can be done by configuring the following generators.yml:
        ```yml
        api:
          environments:
            Production:
              urls:
                api: https://api.com
                auth: https://auth.com
            Staging:
                api: https://stagingapi.com
                auth: https://stagingauth.com
          specs:
            - openapi: path/to/openapi
              overrides: path/to/overrides
        ```

        Note that you will need to use the `x-fern-server-name` annotation on each endpoint to assign it to a relevant server. For example,

        ```yml
        paths:
          /api/users/:
            get:
              x-fern-server-name: api
          /token:
            post:
              x-fern-server-name: auth
        ```

        Adds generic object declarations to the fern definition. Now we can define generics and
        use them in alias declarations to minimize code duplication:

        ```yml
        types:
          GenericTest<T>:
            properties:
              value: T
              other-value: string

          GenericApplication:

        ```

          path: path/to/openapi.yml

          The OpenAPI importer now handles generating examples for circular `oneOf` schemas. Previously, the
          the converter would only default to generating examples for the first `oneOf` schema. If the first variant,
          circularly referenced itself, this would make terminating the example impossible.
          Now, the example generator tries every schema in order, guaranteeing that a termination condition will be
          reached.

      type: fix
      fixed:
        - |
          Previously, object declarations with extends and no properties did not have examples
          propagating in the Docs and SDKs. The core issue was in IR generation which has now
          been resolved.
