    - summary: |
        Add `--preview-output-dir` option to `fern generate` command. This allows users to specify a custom output directory for preview generation when using the `--preview` flag for SDK generation, instead of the default `.preview` directory.

    - summary: |
        Fix per-generator API overrides incorrectly falling back to workspace name for namespace. The `namespace` field in per-generator specs configuration now correctly uses the provided value (or `undefined` if not set) instead of falling back to the workspace folder name.

        Fix OpenAPI example summary not appearing as tab titles in API reference docs. The `displayName` (derived from OpenAPI `summary` field) is now always preserved in FDR output, even when there's only one example per status code. Previously, example names were only shown when multiple examples had the same status code.

  changelogEntry:
    - summary: |
        Fix OpenAPI example summary field propagation. The `summary` field from OpenAPI examples is now correctly propagated to the IR `displayName` field and FDR `name` field. Previously, when examples were referenced via `$ref`, the summary field was lost because the reference was not resolved before checking for the summary. Also adds support for recursive `$ref` resolution in examples.

        Add air-gapped environment detection for AI example enhancement. The CLI now detects network availability before attempting AI enhancement by checking connectivity to Venus.

- version: 3.39.4
  changelogEntry:
    - summary: |
        Optimize air-gapped environment detection for protobuf generation. The CLI now detects network availability once at startup using a 30-second timeout instead of having multiple timeouts for each buf command. Both `ProtobufIRGenerator` and `ProtobufOpenAPIGenerator` now use a shared `detectAirGappedMode()` utility function that sets an `isAirGapped` flag to skip network calls after initial detection. This significantly improves performance in air-gapped environments.

  changelogEntry:
    - summary: |
        Fix protobuf air-gapped support to properly catch execa exceptions when `buf dep update` fails. The `execa` library throws exceptions on non-zero exit codes rather than returning a result object, so the network error detection logic was never being reached. Both `ProtobufOpenAPIGenerator` and `ProtobufIRGenerator` now wrap `buf dep update` in a try-catch block to properly handle network errors in air-gapped environments.

- version: 3.39.1
  changelogEntry:
    - summary: |
        Fix protobuf air-gapped support to properly populate buf cache at build time. Both `ProtobufOpenAPIGenerator` and `ProtobufIRGenerator` now always attempt `buf dep update` first to populate the cache, and only continue on network errors if a pre-cached `buf.lock` file exists. This ensures dependencies are cached at build time while still supporting air-gapped runtime environments.

        later adds required fields; kwargs are more stable.

    - summary: |
        Fix protobuf OpenAPI generation to support air-gapped environments. The CLI now checks for a pre-cached `buf.lock` file in the proto directory before calling `buf dep update`. This enables self-hosted deployments with `from-openapi: true` proto specs to work in air-gapped environments by pre-caching dependencies.
