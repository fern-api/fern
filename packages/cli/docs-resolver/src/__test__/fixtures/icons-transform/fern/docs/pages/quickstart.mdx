# 🚀 Quickstart

Welcome to **Hollowframe** — where your code doesn’t just run, it *drifts*.  
This guide will walk you through spinning up your first distributed frame.

## Step 1: Create a New Frame

```bash
hollow create starlight
cd starlight
```

This creates a new frame called **Starlight**, with boilerplate code for a basic reactive function.

## Step 2: Start Your Local Environment

```bash
hollow dev
```

You’ll see logs as your frame activates and binds to its default port.

```
🌌 Spinning up frame starlight...
✨ Ready at http://localhost:4242
```

## Step 3: Deploy to the Hollowverse

Once everything looks good locally, deploy your frame:

```bash
hollow deploy
```

After deployment, Hollowframe will provide a public endpoint and a unique visualization in the Hollowverse UI.

## Step 4: Explore the Dashboard

Visit [app.hollowframe.dev](https://app.hollowframe.dev) to monitor your live frame.  
See real-time logs, latency metrics, and even visualize inter-frame interactions.
