# ⚙️ Installation Guide

Installing **HollowFrame** is simple, no matter your platform or vibe.

## 1. Using npm

If you're a JavaScript or TypeScript developer, install the SDK via npm:

```bash
npm install -g hollowframe
```

To verify installation:

```bash
hollow --version
```

## 2. Using Homebrew

Prefer your binaries brewed fresh? Use Homebrew:

```bash
brew tap hollowframe/hollow
brew install hollow
```

Once installed, run:

```bash
hollow init
```

You'll be greeted by the HollowFrame CLI wizard that walks you through:
- Connecting your account
- Creating your first workspace
- Generating a local config file

## 3. Using Curl (Manual Install)

If you're running headless servers or lightweight containers:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.hollowframe.dev/install.sh | bash
```

This will install the binary to `/usr/local/bin/hollow`.
