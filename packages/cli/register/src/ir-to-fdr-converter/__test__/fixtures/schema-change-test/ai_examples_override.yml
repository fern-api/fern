# This file simulates AI-generated examples that were created BEFORE the schema change
# It contains properties that NO LONGER EXIST in the current OpenAPI spec:
# - isbn (removed from both request and response)
# - publishedYear (removed from both request and response)
#
# And it's MISSING new properties that were added:
# - addedDate (new in response)
# - status (new in response)
#
# This demonstrates the problem: AI examples don't auto-update when schema changes
