# This file tests that AI examples are written in the correct x-fern-examples format:
# 1. Request should be direct value (not wrapped in body)
# 2. Response should have body wrapper
# 3. Path/query/header parameters should be in their own sections, not in request body
# 4. Plain values should be used (not FDR typed value wrappers like {type: "filename", value: "..."})
