        "description": "Many resources in the Flexport API contain attributes that are references to another resource or a collection of\nresources. For example, a shipment has a reference to a collection of legs. Expansion can be used to replace\nthose references with the actual data that they represent. This is helpful in eliminating subsequent calls\nrequired to retrieve all data relevant to a resource.\n\nExpansion is controlled via the expand query parameter. Multiple references can be expanded by providing\nmultiple items in the expansion array. Expansion may also be recursive, i.e. expanded references can be further\nexpanded.\n\nExpansion is valid for both ObjectRef and CollectionRef attributes.\n\n## Examples\n\nHere are some different ways that the expand query parameter can be used with the Container API.

They allow you to be notified of changes\non your Flexport data and milestone events for your shipments.\n\n## Setting a Secret Token\nIn order to verify that only requests coming from Flexport are allowed into your system, we require you to set\na secret token for each of your endpoints. Flexport sends an X-Hub-Signature header with the value set as\ndemonstrated on the right with each message. By verifying this header matches your expectations, we can ensure\nthat only people with the secret token can send data to your endpoint.\n\n## Payloads\nThe payload for a webhook is an `Event` object.\n\nFlexport uses your secret token and the payload to create a hash signature with each payload. This hash\nsignature is passed along with each request in the headers as `X-Hub-Signature`. To validate the payload:\n\n1. Generate a SHA1 signature using the payload and your secret token.\n2. Compare your signature to the signature in the X-Hub-Signature header string. If they match, then the payload is genuine.\n\n## Response\nFlexport expects to receive an HTTP `200` response code from your endpoint. We will continue trying to deliver\nthe message a number of times if we don’t receive one. To prevent time outs, it is wise to configure your\nendpoints to send a `200` and then do any long running processing on the data.\n"
