        Cutoff times are very slowly changing data. This is a _conditional

        to this operation, this operation returns a 304 Not Modified when called
        again if the cutoff times have not changed.

        not strictly enforced; a transfer can still be scheduled to occur on
        restricted dates but the financial institution may shift the date when
        funds are drafted to account for holidays, closures, or to adjust based
        on the risk level of the funding account.

        Create a new transfer within the transfers collection. If all the
        necessary properties are set, the transfer is queued for processing. If
        the request omits the `schedule.scheduledOn` date, the transfer remains
        pending/unscheduled until the user sets it via the
        [`patchTransfer`](#op-patchTransfer) operation.


        Note: This operation requires an identity challenge if the financial
        institution requires the user to proove their identity for some types of
        transfers. See the "Challenges API".
