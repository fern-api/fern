        Updates the current inventory levels for a particular SKU item. Updates
        may be given in one or two methods, absolutely or incrementally.
        Absolute updates are done by setting `quantity` directly. Incremental
        updates are by specifying the inventory delta in `updateQuantity` which
        is then added to the `quantity` stored on the server.

In order to create a Product with multiple SKUs - for example a T-shirt in sizes small, medium and large - you'll need to create `sku-properties`. In our T-shirt example, a single `sku-property` would be Color. Within that property, we'll need to list out the various colors a T-shirt could be as an array of `enum` values: `royal-blue`, `crimson-red`, and `forrest-green`.

Once, you've created a Product and its `sku-properties` with `enum` values, you can create your default SKU, which will automatically be a combination of the first `sku-properties` you've created. In our example, the default SKU will be a Royal Blue T-Shirt, because our first `enum` of our Color `sku-property` is Royal Blue. After you've created your product, you can create additional SKUs using the <a href="https://developers.webflow.com/reference/create-skus">Create SKU endpoint</a>

Upon creation, the default product type will be `Advanced`. The product type is used to determine which Product and SKU fields are shown to users in the `Designer` and the `Editor`. Setting it to `Advanced` ensures that all Product and SKU fields will be shown.

        Creating a new Product involves creating both a Product and a SKU, since
        a Product Item has to have, at minimum, a single SKU.


        In order to create a Product with multiple SKUs - for example a T-shirt
        in sizes small, medium and large - you'll need to create
        `sku-properties`. In our T-shirt example, a single `sku-property` would
        be Color. Within that property, we'll need to list out the various
        colors a T-shirt could be as an array of `enum` values: `royal-blue`,
        `crimson-red`, and `forrest-green`.


        Once, you've created a Product and its `sku-properties` with `enum`
        values, you can create your default SKU, which will automatically be a
        combination of the first `sku-properties` you've created. In our
        example, the default SKU will be a Royal Blue T-Shirt, because our first
        `enum` of our Color `sku-property` is Royal Blue. After you've created
        your product, you can create additional SKUs using the <a
        href="https://developers.webflow.com/reference/create-skus">Create SKU
        endpoint</a>


        Upon creation, the default product type will be `Advanced`. The product
        type is used to determine which Product and SKU fields are shown to
        users in the `Designer` and the `Editor`. Setting it to `Advanced`
        ensures that all Product and SKU fields will be shown.

        Create additional SKUs to cover every variant of your Product. The
        Default SKU already counts as one of the variants.


        Creating additional SKUs will set the product type to `Advanced` for the
        product associated with the SKUs. The product type is used to determine
        which Product and SKU fields are shown to users in the `Designer` and
        the `Editor`. Setting it to `Advanced` ensures that all Product and SKU
        fields will be shown. The product type can be edited in the `Designer`
        or the `Editor`.
