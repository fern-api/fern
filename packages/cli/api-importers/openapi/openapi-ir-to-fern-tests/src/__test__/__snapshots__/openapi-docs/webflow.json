              "docs": "Creating a new Product involves creating both a Product and a SKU, since a Product Item has to have, at minimum, a single SKU.

In order to create a Product with multiple SKUs - for example a T-shirt in sizes small, medium and large - you'll need to create `sku-properties`. In our T-shirt example, a single `sku-property` would be Color. Within that property, we'll need to list out the various colors a T-shirt could be as an array of `enum` values: `royal-blue`, `crimson-red`, and `forrest-green`.

Once, you've created a Product and its `sku-properties` with `enum` values, you can create your default SKU, which will automatically be a combination of the first `sku-properties` you've created. In our example, the default SKU will be a Royal Blue T-Shirt, because our first `enum` of our Color `sku-property` is Royal Blue. After you've created your product, you can create additional SKUs using the <a href="https://developers.webflow.com/reference/create-skus">Create SKU endpoint</a>

Upon creation, the default product type will be `Advanced`. The product type is used to determine which Product and SKU fields are shown to users in the `Designer` and the `Editor`. Setting it to `Advanced` ensures that all Product and SKU fields will be shown.

      docs: >-
        Creating a new Product involves creating both a Product and a SKU, since
        a Product Item has to have, at minimum, a single SKU.


        In order to create a Product with multiple SKUs - for example a T-shirt
        in sizes small, medium and large - you'll need to create
        `sku-properties`. In our T-shirt example, a single `sku-property` would
        be Color. Within that property, we'll need to list out the various
        colors a T-shirt could be as an array of `enum` values: `royal-blue`,
        `crimson-red`, and `forrest-green`.


        Once, you've created a Product and its `sku-properties` with `enum`
        values, you can create your default SKU, which will automatically be a
        combination of the first `sku-properties` you've created. In our
        example, the default SKU will be a Royal Blue T-Shirt, because our first
        `enum` of our Color `sku-property` is Royal Blue. After you've created
        your product, you can create additional SKUs using the <a
        href="https://developers.webflow.com/reference/create-skus">Create SKU
        endpoint</a>


        Upon creation, the default product type will be `Advanced`. The product
        type is used to determine which Product and SKU fields are shown to
        users in the `Designer` and the `Editor`. Setting it to `Advanced`
        ensures that all Product and SKU fields will be shown.
