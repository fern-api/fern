      "description": "APIs for digital banking client applications.\n\n## Customer Accounts\n\nCustomer-level API for listing banking accounts, balances, and other account-specific data.\n\nClients may use this API to:\n\n  * [`listAccounts`](#op-listAccounts) - obtain a list of accounts that the authorized user has access to,\n  returning a [`accounts`](#schema-accounts) collection with a `list` of account objects.\n  * [`listEligibleAchAccounts`](#op-listEligibleAchAccounts) - obtain a list of ACH accounts that allow\n  transfers based on SEC code and authorized account privileges.\n  * [`listAccountBalances`](#op-listAccountBalances) - list the balances of the customer' accounts.\n  * [`getAccount`](#op-getAccount) - Fetch a more complete set of properties of an internal account.\n  * Manage overdraft protection:\n    * [`listEligibleOverdraftAccounts`](#op-listEligibleOverdraftAccounts) - List accounts which may be set as\n    overdraft protection accounts for another account.\n    * [`getOverdraftProtection`](#op-getOverdraftProtection) - fetch an account's overdraft protection settings.\n    * [`patchOverdraftAccounts`](#op-patchOverdraftAccounts) - update an account's overdraft protection settings.\n\n## Financial Institutions\n\nOperations related to bank and credit union financial institutions (FIs). This API provides the following features\n\n  1. [Calculating upcoming dates](#op-listTransferSchedule) for transfer schedules, factoring in weekends, non-business days, and\n  banking holidays as determined by the institution,\n  1. Provide a [list of transfer date restrictions](#op-getTransferDateRestrictions):\n  dates when users should not schedule transfers, based on transfer parameters,\n  1. [Look up a financial institution](#op-lookUpInstitutionByLocator) by an FI locator value: either an ABA routing and transit number,\n  an IBAN account number, or a SWIFT/BIC code,\n  1. [Fetching Cutoff times for FI money movement requests](#op-getCutoffTimes).\n\nSome of the operations in this API require an `institutionId` path parameter. This is the unique alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies a financial institution.\n\n## Account Transactions\n\nThe Transactions API allows bank customers to view the transactions history associated with a banking account. The client may filter the transaction history by date, amount, transaction type, and other criteria. The transaction response is paginated since there may be many thousands of transactions for an account.\n\nTransactions have a `type` which indicates if the item is a balance transaction which establishes the account's balance, or a `debit`, or a `credit` transaction. Examples of debit transactions are checks drawn against an account, withdrawals, transfers from the account, fees, and adjustments. Examples of credit transactions are deposits, transfers to the account, interest, and adjustments. Check transactions include the check number and links to the check front and back images.\n\nSome transactions, such as ACH transfers or debit card payments, include information about the merchant, such as the merchant name, the merchant's website URL, and logo URL if available.\n\nTransactions also have a `memo` descriptive field which the customer can change. Each non-balance transaction can also be assigned to a _category_. The customer can edit their list of custom transaction categories. There is also a pre-defined list of fixed categories. (_Category management is to be designed._)\n\n**Note:** The financial institution may limit transaction history to the last 12 months of data.\n\n## Account to Account Transfers\n\nSchedule and manage account to account transfers.\n\nWhen creating new simple transfers, the source and target accounts, amount, and transfer schedule are required and the transfer is scheduled to be processed on the scheduled date. Some financial institutions support immediate transfers between local accounts scheduled on the current day. Transfers to or from external accounts typically are processed after the financial institution's ACH cut-off time but require several business days.\n\nTransfers have a [`state`](#schema-transferState) property which indicates if the transfer is pending, pending approvals, scheduled (queued for processing), processing, or processed.\n\nTransfers support recurring schedules, such as repeating every week or every month. Recurring transfers can also be variable transfers; they recur without an amount. Occasional recurring transfers do not have a scheduled date. Both of these situations result in transfers in a `pending` state. They remain pending until a [`patchTransfer`](#op-patchTransfer) operation sets the amount and schedule. Once a `pending` transfer has an amount and schedule, it becomes `scheduled`.",
