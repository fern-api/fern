        description: |
          Optional fields that override our gas and fee estimates. Use this parameter to optionally override available fields: `maxFeePerGas`, `maxPriorityFeePerGas`, `callGasLimit`, `verificationGasLimit`, or `preVerificationGas`. 

          This will apply either:
          - absolutes overrides (using a hex string) simply overriding estimated values entirely OR
          - multiplier overrides relative to our estimates (in the format of { "multiplier": number } with max precision of 4 decimal places). For example, if the override value is { multiplier: 1.1 } for the `maxPriorityFeePerGas` field, then a 1.1 multiplier, or a 10% increase, is applied to the estimated `maxPriorityFeePerGas` of the userOp.

          These overrides will be applied for every userOp sent with this provider. A higher buffer may give userOps a better chance to mine if the L1/L2 gas and fees change.

          ```json
          "overrides": {
            "maxFeePerGas": "hex string" | { "multiplier": number },
            "maxPriorityFeePerGas": "hex string" | { "multiplier": number },
            "callGasLimit": "hex string" | { "multiplier": number },

            "preVerificationGas": "hex string" | { "multiplier": number },
          }
          ```

          <Warning>
            Previous override using "percentage" has been deprecated in favor of "multiplier" values
