  description: >
    Deepgram's voice AI platform provides APIs for speech-to-text,
    text-to-speech, and language understanding. From medical transcription to
    autonomous agents, Deepgram is the go-to choice for developers of voice AI
    experiences.

    The Deepgram API allows you to interact with Deepgram programmatically.

    You can use our Websockets to: - Transcribe speech to text. - Transform text
    to speech. - Build a Voice Agent.
