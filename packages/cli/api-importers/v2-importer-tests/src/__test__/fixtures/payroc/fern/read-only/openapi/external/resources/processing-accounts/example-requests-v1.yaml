    createReminderForProcessingAccount:
      summary: Create reminder for processing account
      description: | 
        When you create a processing account, we send a copy of the pricing agreement to the merchant to sign. You can choose to send them a copy of the pricing agreement by email, or you can generate a link to the pricing agreement.<br/>  
        If you requested the merchant's signature by email and they don't respond, use our Reminders endpoint to create a reminder and to send another email.<br/>  
        **Note:** You can use the Reminders endpoint only if you request the merchant's signature by email. If you generate a link to the pricing agreement, you can't use the Reminders endpoint.

      description: |

        **Note**: You need the ID of the merchant's processing account before you can create an order. If you don't know the processingAccountId, go to [Retrieve a Merchant Platform.](#getMerchantAcccounts)
