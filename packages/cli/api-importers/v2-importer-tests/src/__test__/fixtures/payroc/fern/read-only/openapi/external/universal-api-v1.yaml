  - name: Event Subscriptions
    description: |
      Create an event subscription so that we notify you when certain events occur, for example, when we change the status of a processing account.  
      When you subscribe to an event, provide the following information:  
        - **Event type** - The events that we should notify you about. You can subscribe to more than one event within the same request. For a list of events that you can subscribe to, go to [Events](https://docs.payroc.com/knowledge/basic-concepts/events).  
        - **Notification method** - The endpoint that we send a notification to if an event occurs. We send notifications by webhook request.  
        - **Event status** - The status of the event subscription.  
        - **Support email address** - Email address that we contact if we can't deliver notifications.  
      <br/>  
      Use our event subscriptions endpoint to do the following:  
      - [**Create event subscription**](#createEventSubscription) - Subscribe to receive notifications when events occur.  
      - [**Update event subscription**](#updateEventSubscription) - Change the details of an event subscription, for example, to receive notifications for an additional event.  
      - [**Partially update an event subscription**](#patchEventSubscription) - Change values of an existing event subscription.  
      - [**Retrieve an event subscription**](#getEventSubscription) - Retrieve all the information that we stored in an event subscription. 
      - [**List event subscriptions**](#listEventSubscriptions) - Retrieve a list of all event subscriptions associated with the ISV's account.  
      - [**Delete event subscription**](#deleteEventSubscription)

        - [Create and add an additional processing account to a merchant platform.](#createProcessingAccount)  
        - [Retrieve a merchant platform.](#getMerchantAcccounts)  
        - [Retrieve a list of merchant platforms.](#listMerchantPlatforms)
