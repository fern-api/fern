        Check if a customer’s card is eligible for Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC).
        If the card is eligible for DCC, offer currency conversion to the customer during a transaction.  
        **Note:** We offer this through the DCC service, which gives customers a choice to pay in the local currency or their own currency.
