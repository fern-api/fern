     * - **Better naming**: Meaningful example names like "Schema Example" instead of undefined values
     * - **openapi-sampler integration**: High-quality auto-generated examples using mature schema-to-example generation
     * - **Request/Response optimization**: Minimal examples for requests (required fields only), comprehensive examples for responses (all fields)
     * - **Bounded generation**: Unlimited user-specified examples, maximum 3 auto-generated examples to prevent bloat
     *
     * This addresses the core issue where schema-level examples were completely ignored, leading to incomplete API documentation.
