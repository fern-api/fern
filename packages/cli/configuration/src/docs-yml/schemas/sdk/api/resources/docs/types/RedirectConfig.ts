 * The `redirects` object allows you to redirect traffic from one path to another. You can redirect exact paths or use dynamic patterns with regex parameters like `:slug` to handle bulk redirects. You can redirect to internal paths within your site or external URLs.
 *
 * ```yaml
 * redirects:
 *   - source: "/old-path"
 *     destination: "/new-path"
 * ```
 *
 * Both source and destination paths support regex. See https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp
