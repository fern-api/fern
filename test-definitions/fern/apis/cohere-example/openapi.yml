                Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced AI systems trained on
                vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like
                text. They use deep learning architectures, particularly
                transformers, to process and produce language.


                Key characteristics of LLMs include:


                1. **Scale**: They're trained on billions or trillions of
                parameters, making them capable of understanding complex
                patterns in language.


                2. **Versatility**: LLMs can perform various tasks like
                translation, summarization, question answering, and creative
                writing without being explicitly programmed for each task.


                3. **Context Understanding**: They can maintain context over
                long conversations and generate coherent, contextually relevant
                responses.


                4. **Few-shot Learning**: LLMs can often perform new tasks with
                just a few examples, adapting to new scenarios quickly.


                Popular examples include GPT (Generative Pre-trained
                Transformer) models, BERT, and Cohere's Command models. These
                models have revolutionized natural language processing and
                enabled new applications across industries.

The latter is the only one we haven’t study so far. It took 15 years and Adele to break their record of 2,4 million units sold of No Strings Attached in its first week alone.\n\nIt wasn’t a fluke, as the second fastest selling album of the Soundscan era prior 2015, was also theirs since Celebrity debuted with 1,88 million units sold.",

This concept will not only bring you sales information for all NSYNC‘s albums, physical and download singles, as well as audio and video streaming, but it will also determine their true popularity. If you are not yet familiar with the CSPC method, the next page explains it with a short video. I fully recommend watching the video before getting into the sales figures.',

                  It wasn’t a fluke, as the second fastest selling album of the

                Both NSync and Backstreet Boys were extremely popular at the
                turn of the millennium. Backstreet Boys had massive album sales
                across the globe, great singles sales, plenty of chart-topping
                releases, hyped tours, and tremendous media coverage. NSync also
                had huge sales, with their album No Strings Attached selling 2.4
                million units in its first week. They also had the second
                fastest-selling album of the Soundscan era before 2015, with
                Celebrity debuting at 1.88 million units sold.


                While it is difficult to say for sure which of the two bands was
                more popular, Backstreet Boys did have success in some countries
                that were traditionally hard to penetrate for Western artists.

                    CSPC: NSYNC Popularity Analysis

                    At the turn of the millennium three teen acts were huge in
                    the US, the Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears and NSYNC. The
                    latter is the only one we haven’t study so far. It took 15
                    years and Adele to break their record of 2,4 million units
                    sold of No Strings Attached in its first week alone.


                    It wasn’t a fluke, as the second fastest selling album of
                    the Soundscan era prior 2015, was also theirs since
                    Celebrity debuted with 1,88 million units sold.

                    Music industry – One step closer to being accurate


                    CSPC: Backstreet Boys Popularity Analysis

                    At one point, Backstreet Boys defined success: massive
                    albums sales across the globe, great singles sales, plenty
                    of chart topping releases, hugely hyped tours and tremendous
                    media coverage.


                    It is true that they benefited from extraordinarily good
                    market conditions in all markets. After all, the all-time
                    record year for the music business, as far as revenues in
                    billion dollars are concerned, was actually 1999. That is,
                    back when this five men group was at its peak.

                    1997, 1998, 2000 and 2001 also rank amongst some of the very
                    best years.

                    Yet the way many music consumers – especially teenagers and
                    young women’s – embraced their output deserves its own
                    chapter. If Jonas Brothers and more recently One Direction
                    reached a great level of popularity during the past decade,
                    the type of success achieved by Backstreet Boys is in a
                    completely different level as they really dominated the
                    business for a few years all over the world, including in
                    some countries that were traditionally hard to penetrate for
                    Western artists.


                    We will try to analyze the extent of that hegemony with this
                    new article with final results which will more than surprise
                    many readers.

                    When `true`, the response will be a JSON stream of events. The final event will contain the complete response, and will have an `event_type` of `"stream-end"`.

                    Streaming is beneficial for user interfaces that render the contents of the response piece by piece, as it gets generated.

                    The `SYSTEM` role is also used for the contents of the optional `chat_history=` parameter. When used with the `chat_history=` parameter it adds content throughout a conversation. Conversely, when used with the `preamble=` parameter it adds content at the start of the conversation only.

                    Each item represents a single message in the chat history, excluding the current user turn. It has two properties: `role` and `message`. The `role` identifies the sender (`CHATBOT`, `SYSTEM`, or `USER`), while the `message` contains the text content.

                    The chat_history parameter should not be used for `SYSTEM` messages in most cases. Instead, to add a `SYSTEM` role message at the beginning of a conversation, the `preamble` parameter should be used.

                    With `prompt_truncation` set to "AUTO", some elements from `chat_history` and `documents` will be dropped in an attempt to construct a prompt that fits within the model's context length limit. During this process the order of the documents and chat history will be changed and ranked by relevance.

                    With `prompt_truncation` set to "AUTO_PRESERVE_ORDER", some elements from `chat_history` and `documents` will be dropped in an attempt to construct a prompt that fits within the model's context length limit. During this process the order of the documents and chat history will be preserved as they are inputted into the API.

                    With `prompt_truncation` set to "OFF", no elements will be dropped. If the sum of the inputs exceeds the model's context length limit, a `TooManyTokens` error will be returned.

                    ```
                    [
                      { "title": "Tall penguins", "text": "Emperor penguins are the tallest." },
                      { "title": "Penguin habitats", "text": "Emperor penguins only live in Antarctica." },
                    ]
                    ```

                    Keys and values from each document will be serialized to a string and passed to the model. The resulting generation will include citations that reference some of these documents.

                    Some suggested keys are "text", "author", and "date". For better generation quality, it is recommended to keep the total word count of the strings in the dictionary to under 300 words.

                    An `id` field (string) can be optionally supplied to identify the document in the citations. This field will not be passed to the model.

                    An `_excludes` field (array of strings) can be optionally supplied to omit some key-value pairs from being shown to the model. The omitted fields will still show up in the citation object. The "_excludes" field will not be passed to the model.

                    See ['Document Mode'](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag#document-mode) in the guide for more information.

                    A list of results from invoking tools recommended by the model in the previous chat turn. Results are used to produce a text response and will be referenced in citations. When using `tool_results`, `tools` must be passed as well.
                    Each tool_result contains information about how it was invoked, as well as a list of outputs in the form of dictionaries.

                    **Note**: `outputs` must be a list of objects. If your tool returns a single object (eg `{"status": 200}`), make sure to wrap it in a list.
                    ```
                    tool_results = [

                    **Note**: Chat calls with `tool_results` should not be included in the Chat history to avoid duplication of the message text.

                    text: "LLMs stand for Large Language Models, which are a type of neural network
                      model specialized in processing and generating human
                      language. They are designed to understand and respond to
                      natural language input and have become increasingly
                      popular and valuable in recent years.


                      LLMs are trained on vast amounts of text data, enabling
                      them to learn patterns, grammar, and semantic meanings
                      present in the language. These models can then be used for
                      various natural language processing tasks, such as text
                      generation, summarization, question answering, machine
                      translation, sentiment analysis, and even some aspects of
                      natural language understanding.


                      Some well-known examples of LLMs include:


                      1. GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) — An
                      open-source LLM developed by OpenAI, capable of generating
                      human-like text and performing various language tasks.


                      2. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
                      Transformers) — A Google-developed LLM that is
                      particularly good at understanding contextual
                      relationships in text, and is widely used for natural
                      language understanding tasks like sentiment analysis and
                      named entity recognition.


                      3. T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) — Also from
                      Google, T5 is a flexible LLM that frames all language
                      tasks as text-to-text problems, where the model learns to
                      generate output text based on input text prompts.


                      4. RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Approach) — A variant
                      of BERT that uses additional training techniques to
                      improve performance.


                      5. DeBERTa (Decoding-enhanced BERT with disentangled
                      attention) — Another variant of BERT that introduces a new
                      attention mechanism.


                      LLMs have become increasingly powerful and larger in
                      scale, improving the accuracy and sophistication of
                      language tasks. They are also being used as a foundation
                      for developing various applications, including chatbots,
                      content recommendation systems, language translation
                      services, and more.

                      The future of LLMs holds the potential for even more
                      sophisticated language technologies, with ongoing research
                      and development focused on enhancing their capabilities,
                      improving efficiency, and exploring their applications in
                      various domains."

                    At one point, Backstreet Boys defined success: massive
                    albums sales across the globe, great singles sales, plenty
                    of chart topping releases, hugely hyped tours and tremendous
                    media coverage.


                    It is true that they benefited from extraordinarily good
                    market conditions in all markets. After all, the all-time
                    record year for the music business, as far as revenues in
                    billion dollars are concerned, was actually 1999. That is,
                    back when this five men group was at its peak.

                    sold of No Strings Attached in its first week alone.


                    It wasn’t a fluke, as the second fastest selling album of
                    the Soundscan era prior 2015, was also theirs since
                    Celebrity debuted with 1,88 million units sold.

                    1997, 1998, 2000 and 2001 also rank amongst some of the very
                    best years.

                    Yet the way many music consumers – especially teenagers and
                    young women’s – embraced their output deserves its own
                    chapter. If Jonas Brothers and more recently One Direction
                    reached a great level of popularity during the past decade,
                    the type of success achieved by Backstreet Boys is in a
                    completely different level as they really dominated the
                    business for a few years all over the world, including in
                    some countries that were traditionally hard to penetrate for
                    Western artists.


                    We will try to analyze the extent of that hegemony with this
                    new article with final results which will more than surprise
                    many readers.

                    Was the teen group led by Justin Timberlake really that big?
                    Was it only in the US where they found success? Or were they
                    a global phenomenon?

                    As usual, I’ll be using the Commensurate Sales to Popularity
                    Concept in order to relevantly gauge their results. This
                    concept will not only bring you sales information for all
                    NSYNC‘s albums, physical and download singles, as well as
                    audio and video streaming, but it will also determine their
                    true popularity. If you are not yet familiar with the CSPC
                    method, the next page explains it with a short video. I
                    fully recommend watching the video before getting into the
                    sales figures.

                      Both NSync and Backstreet Boys were extremely popular at
                      the turn of the millennium. Backstreet Boys had massive
                      album sales across the globe, great singles sales, plenty
                      of chart-topping releases, hyped tours, and tremendous
                      media coverage. NSync also had huge sales, with their
                      album No Strings Attached selling 2.4 million units in its
                      first week. They also had the second fastest-selling album
                      of the Soundscan era before 2015, with Celebrity debuting
                      at 1.88 million units sold.


                      While it is difficult to say for sure which of the two
                      bands was more popular, Backstreet Boys did have success
                      in some countries that were traditionally hard to
                      penetrate for Western artists.

                    text: success in some countries that were traditionally hard to penetrate for
                      Western artists.

                            the very best years.

                            Yet the way many music consumers – especially
                            teenagers and young women’s – embraced their output
                            deserves its own chapter. If Jonas Brothers and more
                            recently One Direction reached a great level of
                            popularity during the past decade, the type of
                            success achieved by Backstreet Boys is in a
                            completely different level as they really dominated
                            the business for a few years all over the world,
                            including in some countries that were traditionally
                            hard to penetrate for Western artists.


                            We will try to analyze the extent of that hegemony
                            with this new article with final results which will
                            more than surprise many readers.

                      The image you've provided is quite abstract and blurred, making it challenging to discern specific details. However, I can describe the general shapes and colors present:

                      1. **Shapes and Colors:**
                        - There are three main shapes in the image.
                        - The largest shape at the top is a dark green, irregular oval.
                        - Below it, on the left, there's a smaller, bright orange circle.
                        - To the right of the orange circle, there's another oval shape, this one in a light purple color.

                      2. **Arrangement:**
                        - The green oval is positioned at the top center of the image.
                        - The orange circle is directly below the green oval, slightly to the left.
                        - The purple oval is to the right of the orange circle, forming a rough triangular arrangement with the other two shapes.

                      3. **Blurriness:**
                        - The entire image is blurred, which softens the edges of the shapes and makes it difficult to identify any specific details or textures within the shapes.

                      Given the abstract nature of the image, it's open to interpretation. The shapes could represent various objects or concepts depending on the viewer's perspective. If you have any specific questions about the image or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

                    At one point, Backstreet Boys defined success: massive
                    albums sales across the globe, great singles sales, plenty
                    of chart topping releases, hugely hyped tours and tremendous
                    media coverage.


                    It is true that they benefited from extraordinarily good

                    At the turn of the millennium three teen acts were huge in
                    the US, the Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears and NSYNC. The
                    latter is the only one we haven’t study so far. It took 15
                    years and Adele to break their record of 2,4 million units
                    sold of No Strings Attached in its first week alone.


                    It wasn’t a fluke, as the second fastest selling album of
                    the Soundscan era prior 2015, was also theirs since
                    Celebrity debuted with 1,88 million units sold.

                    Yet the way many music consumers – especially teenagers and
                    young women’s – embraced their output deserves its own

                    reached a great level of popularity during the past decade,
                    the type of success achieved by Backstreet Boys is in a
                    completely different level as they really dominated the
                    business for a few years all over the world, including in
                    some countries that were traditionally hard to penetrate for
                    Western artists.


                    We will try to analyze the extent of that hegemony with this
                    new article with final results which will more than surprise

                    LLMs, or Large Language Models, are a type of neural
                    network-based AI model that has been trained on massive
                    amounts of text data and have become ubiquitous in the AI
                    landscape. They possess astounding capabilities for
                    comprehending and generating human-like language.

                    These models leverage neural networks that operate on a
                    large scale, often involving millions or even billions of
                    parameters. This substantial scale enables them to capture
                    intricate patterns and connections within the vast amounts
                    of text they have been trained on.


                    The training process for LLMs is fueled by colossal datasets
                    of textual information, ranging from books and articles to
                    websites and conversational transcripts. This extensive
                    training enables them to develop a nuanced understanding of
                    language patterns, grammar, and semantics.


                    When posed with a new text input, LLMs employ their finely
                    honed understanding of language to generate informed
                    responses or undertake tasks such as language translation,
                    text completion, or question answering. They do this by
                    manipulating the input text through adding, removing, or
                    altering elements to craft a desired output.


                    One of the underlying principles of their efficacy is the
                    recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture they often
                    adopt. This design enables them to process sequential data
                    like natural language effectively. RNNs possess "memory"
                    aspects via loops between layers, which allows them to
                    retain and manipulate information gathered across long
                    sequences, akin to the way humans process information.


                    However, it's their size that arguably constitutes their
                    most notable aspect. The sheer volume of these models – with
                    counts of parameters often exceeding 100 million – enables
                    them to capture correlations and patterns within language
                    data effectively. This empowers them to generate coherent
                    and contextually appropriate responses, posing a remarkable
                    advancement in conversational AI.


                    While LLMs have demonstrated extraordinary language prowess,
                    it's vital to acknowledge their limitations and potential
                    for improvement. Their biases often reflect those of the
                    training data, and they may struggle with logical
                    inconsistencies or factual errors. Ongoing research aims to
                    enhance their robustness, diversity, and overall usability.


                    In essence, LLMs are a groundbreaking manifestation of AI's
                    potential to simulate and even extend human language
                    capabilities, while also serving as a testament to the
                    ongoing journey towards refining and perfecting these
                    technologies.

        This endpoint returns text and image embeddings. An embedding is a list of floating point numbers that captures semantic information about the content that it represents.

        Embeddings can be used to create classifiers as well as empower semantic search. To learn more about embeddings, see the embedding page.

        If you want to learn more how to use the embedding model, have a look at the [Semantic Search Guide](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/semantic-search).

                    Passing `START` will discard the start of the input. `END` will discard the end of the input. In both cases, input is discarded until the remaining input is exactly the maximum input token length for the model.

                    If `NONE` is selected, when the input exceeds the maximum input token length an error will be returned.

        This endpoint returns text embeddings. An embedding is a list of floating point numbers that captures semantic information about the text that it represents.

        Embeddings can be used to create text classifiers as well as empower semantic search. To learn more about embeddings, see the embedding page.

        If you want to learn more how to use the embedding model, have a look at the [Semantic Search Guide](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/semantic-search).

                    A list of up to 96 texts to be classified. Each one must be a non-empty string.
                    There is, however, no consistent, universal limit to the length a particular input can be. We perform classification on the first `x` tokens of each input, and `x` varies depending on which underlying model is powering classification. The maximum token length for each model is listed in the "max tokens" column [here](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/models).
                    Note: by default the `truncate` parameter is set to `END`, so tokens exceeding the limit will be automatically dropped. This behavior can be disabled by setting `truncate` to `NONE`, which will result in validation errors for longer texts.

        Represents a single message in the chat history, excluding the current user turn. It has two properties: `role` and `message`. The `role` identifies the sender (`CHATBOT`, `SYSTEM`, or `USER`), while the `message` contains the text content.

        The chat_history parameter should not be used for `SYSTEM` messages in most cases. Instead, to add a `SYSTEM` role message at the beginning of a conversation, the `preamble` parameter should be used.

        Configuration for forcing the model output to adhere to the specified format. Supported on [Command R 03-2024](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/command-r), [Command R+ 04-2024](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/command-r-plus) and newer models.

        The model can be forced into outputting JSON objects (with up to 5 levels of nesting) by setting `{ "type": "json_object" }`.

        A [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) can optionally be provided, to ensure a specific structure.

        **Note**: When using  `{ "type": "json_object" }` your `message` should always explicitly instruct the model to generate a JSON (eg: _"Generate a JSON ..."_) . Otherwise the model may end up getting stuck generating an infinite stream of characters and eventually run out of context length.
        **Limitation**: The parameter is not supported in RAG mode (when any of `connectors`, `documents`, `tools`, `tool_results` are provided).

        The model can be forced into outputting JSON objects by setting `{ "type": "json_object" }`.

        A [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) can optionally be provided, to ensure a specific structure.

        **Note**: When using  `{ "type": "json_object" }` your `message` should always explicitly instruct the model to generate a JSON (eg: _"Generate a JSON ..."_) . Otherwise the model may end up getting stuck generating an infinite stream of characters and eventually run out of context length.

        **Note**: When `json_schema` is not specified, the generated object can have up to 5 layers of nesting.

        **Limitation**: The parameter is not supported when used in combinations with the `documents` or `tools` parameters.
