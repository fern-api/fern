With Fern's Snippets API, you can automatically populate sample SDK code snippets for your documentation, generated from examples in your API definition. For more information, see [SDK snippets](/learn/docs/api-references/sdk-snippets).

  Note: Access to the Snippets API is available with our `Starter` plan or higher. Want to get set up? [Email us](mailto:sales@buildwithfern.com).

## API stability

Some of the documented endpoints are undergoing active development. Use the <Availability type="beta" /> and <Availability type="GA" />
tags to differentiate between those that are stable and those that are not. GA stands for generally available.

## Official API clients

Fern maintains official API clients for Node.js and Python. We recommend using these clients to interact with all stable endpoints. You can find them here:
