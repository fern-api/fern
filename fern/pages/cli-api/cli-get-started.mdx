## Installing Fern CLI

Run the following command to download and install Fern CLI from the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) registry. 

```bash
npm install -g fern-api # install Fern CLI
fern -v # ensure Fern was successfully installed
```

## CLI Quick Start

Get started with these commonly used commands:

```bash title="Common Commands"
# Docs Development
fern init --docs                  # Create a new documentation project
fern docs dev                     # Preview docs locally at localhost:3000
fern generate --docs --preview    # Preview documentation changes
fern generate --docs              # Generate and publish documentation

# SDK Development
fern init                        # Start new SDK project
fern check                       # Validate API definition
fern generate --preview          # Preview SDKs in .preview/ folder
fern generate                    # Generate default SDK group
fern generate --group ts-sdk     # Generate specific SDK group
```

<Note>
The "default SDK group" refers to the group marked as default in your `generators.yml`. Learn more about [default groups](/learn/sdks/introduction/configuration).

    ```
    
    3. When ready to preview or publish:
    ```bash
    fern generate --docs --preview  # Generate a shareable preview link
    fern generate --docs            # Publish to production
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Setting up SDK generation">
    1. Initialize a new SDK project:
    ```bash
    fern init
    ```
    
    2. Configure your generators in [configuration options](/learn/sdks/introduction/configuration)
    
    3. Generate SDKs:
    ```bash
    fern generate --preview                     # Preview changes locally
    fern generate --group python-sdk --preview  # Preview specific SDK group
    fern generate                               # Publish to production
    ```

    <Tip>
      During development, use `--preview` to test your changes locally before publishing. 
      The preview SDK will be generated into the `.preview/` folder.
