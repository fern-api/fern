Fern supports different OpenAPI extensions so that you can generate higher-quality SDKs.

## API version

You can define your API version scheme, such as a `X-API-Version` header. The supported versions and default value are specified like so:

```yaml title="openapi.yaml"
x-fern-version:
  version:
    header: X-API-Version
    default: "2.0.0"
    values:
      - "1.0.0"
      - "2.0.0"
      - "latest"
paths: ...
```

## Global headers

At times, your API will leverage certain headers for every endpoint, or the majority of them, we call these "global headers". For convenience, generated Fern SDKs expose "global headers" to easily be updated on API calls. Take for example an API key, if we declare the API key as a global header, a user will be able to plug theirs in easily:

```python
import os

class Client:

  def __init__(self, *, apiKey: str):
```

To configure global headers, Fern will automatically pull out headers that are used in every request, or the majority of requests, and mark them as global.
In order to label additional headers as global, or to alias the names of global headers, you can leverage the `x-fern-global-headers` extension:

```yaml title="openapi.yml"
x-fern-global-headers:
  - header: custom_api_key
    name: api_key
  - header: userpool_id
    optional: true
```

yields the following client:

```python
import os

class Client:

  def __init__(self, *, apiKey: str, userpoolId: typing.Optional[str])
```

## Enum descriptions and names

OpenAPI doesn't natively support adding descriptions to enum values. To do this in Fern you can use the `x-fern-enum`
extension.

In the example below, we've added some descriptions to enum values. These descriptions will
propagate into the generated SDK and docs website.

```yaml title="openapi.yml" {9-13}
components:
  schemas:
    CardSuit:
      enum:
        - clubs
        - diamonds
        - hearts
        - spades
      x-fern-enum:
        clubs:
          description: Some docs about clubs
        spades:
          description: Some docs about spades
```

`x-fern-enum` also supports a `name` field that allows you to customize the name of the enum in code.
This is particularly useful when you have enums that rely on symbolic characters that would otherwise cause
generated code not to compile.

For example, the following OpenAPI

```yaml title="openapi.yml" {9,12}
components:
  schemas:
    Operand:
      enum:
        - '>'
        - '<'
      x-fern-enum:
        '>':
          name: GreaterThan
          description: Checks if value is greater than
        '<':
          name: LessThan
          description: Checks if value is less than
```

would generate

```typescript title="operand.ts"
export enum Operand {
  GreaterThan = ">",
  LessThan = "<"
}
```

## Schema names

OpenAPI allows you to define inlined schemas that do not have names.

```yaml title="Inline type in openapi.yml" {11}
components:
  schemas:
    Movie:
      type: object
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        cast:
          type: array
          items:
            type: object
            properties:
              firstName:
                type: string
              lastName:
                type: string
              age:
                type: integer
```

Fern automatically generates names for all the inlined schemas. For example, in this example,
Fern would generate the name `CastItem` for the inlined array item schema.

```typescript title="Auto-generated name" {6}
export interface Movie {
  name?: string;
  cast?: CastItem[];
}

export interface CastItem {
  firstName?: string;
  lastName?: string;
  age?: integer;
}
```

If you want to override the generated name, you can use the extension `x-fern-type-name`.

```yaml title="openapi.yml" {12}
components:
  schemas:
    Movie:
      type: object
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        cast:
          type: array
          items:
            type: object
            x-fern-type-name: Person
            properties:
              firstName:
                type: string
              lastName:
                type: string
              age:
                type: integer
```

This would replace `CastItem` with `Person` and the generated code would read more idiomatically:

```typescript title="Overridden name" {6}
export interface Movie {
  name?: string;
  cast?: Person[];
}

export interface Person {
  firstName?: string;
  lastName?: string;
  age?: integer;
}
```

## Property names

The `x-fern-property-name` extension allows you to customize the variable name for object
properties.

For example, if you had a property called `_metadata` in your schema but you wanted the
variable to be called `data` in your SDK you would do the following:

```yaml {6}
components:
  schemas:
    MyUser:
      _metadata:
        type: object
        x-fern-property-name: data
```

## Server names

The `x-fern-server-name` extension is used to name your servers.

```yaml title="openapi.yml"
servers:
  - url: https://api.example.com
    x-fern-server-name: Production
  - url: https://sandbox.example.com
    x-fern-server-name: Sandbox
```

In a generated TypeScript SDK, you'd see:

```typescript title="environment.ts"
export const ExampleEnvironment = {
  Production: "https://api.example.com"
} as const;

export type ExampleEnvironment = typeof ExampleEnvironment.Production;
```

## Base path

The `x-fern-base-path` extension is used to configure the base path prepended to every endpoint.

In the example below, we have configured the `/v1` base path so the full endpoint path is
`https://api.example.com/v1/users`.

```yaml title="Set the base path in openapi.yml" {1}
x-fern-base-path: /v1
servers:
  - url: https://api.example.com
paths:
  /users: ...
```

## Ignoring schemas or endpoints

If you want Fern to skip reading any endpoints or schemas, use the `x-fern-ignore` extension.

To skip an endpoint, add `x-fern-ignore: true` at the operation level.

```yaml title="x-fern-ignore at operation level in openapi.yml" {4}
paths:
  /users:
    get:
      x-fern-ignore: true
      ...
```

To skip a schema, add `x-fern-ignore: true` at the schema level.

```yaml title="x-fern-ignore at schema level in openapi.yml" {4}
components:
  schemas:
    SchemaToSkip:
      x-fern-ignore: true
      ...
```

## Overlaying extensions

Because of the number of tools that use OpenAPI, it may be more convenient to
"overlay" your fern specific OpenAPI extensions onto your original definition. \
In order to do this you can specify your overrides file in `generators.yml`.

Below is an example of how someone can overlay the extensions `x-fern-sdk-method-name` and
`x-fern-sdk-group-name` without polluting their original OpenAPI. The combined result is
shown in the third tab.

<CodeBlocks>
    ```yaml title="generators.yml" {3}
    api:
      specs:
        - openapi: ./openapi/openapi.yml
          overrides: ./openapi/overrides.yaml
    default-group: sdk
    groups:
      sdk:
        generators:
          - name: fernapi/fern-python-sdk
            version: 2.2.0
    ```

    ```yaml title="overrides.yml"
    paths:
      /users:
        get:
          x-fern-sdk-group-name: users
          x-fern-sdk-method-name: get
    ```

    ```yaml title="Overlaid OpenAPI" {4-5}
    paths:
      /users:
        get:
          x-fern-sdk-group-name: users
          x-fern-sdk-method-name: get
          summary: Get a list of users
          description: Retrieve a list of users from the system.
          responses:
            '200':
              description: Successful response
            '500':
              description: Internal Server Error
    ```

</CodeBlocks>

## Embedding extensions

If instead of overlaying your extensions within an overrides file, as mentioned above. Certain frameworks that generate OpenAPI Specifications make it easy to embed extensions directly from code.

## Request + response examples

While OpenAPI has several fields for examples, there is no easy way
to associate a request with a response. This is especially useful when
you want to show more than one example in your documentation.

`x-fern-examples` is an array of examples. Each element of the array
can contain `path-parameters`, `query-parameters`, `request` and `response`
examples values that are all associated.

```yaml title="openapi.yml" {5-16}
paths:
  /users/{userId}:
    get:
      x-fern-examples:
        - path-parameters:
            userId: user-1234
          response:
            body:
              name: Foo
              ssn: 1234
        - path-parameters:
            userId: user-4567
          response:
            body:
              name: Foo
              ssn: 4567
components:
  schemas:
    User:
      type: object
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        ssn:
          type: integer
```

### Code samples

If you'd like to specify custom code samples for your example, use `code-samples`.

```yaml title="openapi.yml" {11-16}
paths:
  /users/{userId}:
    get:
      x-fern-examples:
        - path-parameters:
            userId: user-1234
          response:
            body:
              name: Foo
              ssn: 1234
          code-samples:
            - sdk: typescript
              name: User ID
              code: |
                import { UserClient } from "...";

                client.users.get("user-1234")
            - sdk: typescript
              name: User Name
              code: |
                import { UserClient } from "...";

                client.users.get("Fern Fernie")
```

If you're on the Fern Starter plan or higher for SDKs you won't have to worry about manually adding code samples! Our generators do that for you.

## Availability

The `x-fern-availability` extension is used to mark the availability of an endpoint. The availability information propagates into the generated Fern Docs website as visual tags.

The options are:

- `beta`
- `generally-available`
- `deprecated`

The example below marks that the `POST /pet` endpoint is `deprecated`.

```yaml title="x-fern-availability in openapi.yml" {4}
paths:
  /pet:
    post:
      x-fern-availability: deprecated
```

This renders as:

<Frame caption="A deprecated endpoint">
![Screenshot of API Reference endpoint with tag showing deprecated](https://fern-image-hosting.s3.amazonaws.com/fern/x-fern-availability-example.png)
</Frame>

### Request new extensions
