title: Customize SDK Method Names
description: Use `x-fern-sdk-method-name` and `x-fern-sdk-group-name` to finetune SDK naming.

## Operation IDs

By default, if you have no extensions present, Fern will try to use your operation ID to generate idiomatic 
method names for the SDK. We typically recommend formatting your operation IDs like `{tag_name}_{operation_name}`. 

For example, for an endpoint that has the tag `users` and the operation id `users_get`, we will generate an SDK 
method that is `users.get()`. If your operation id does not start with a tag, then we will simply use it as the method name. 

## Usage

<Note>
  The `x-fern-sdk-group-name` and `x-fern-sdk-method-name` extensions allow you to customize the generated SDK method
  names.
</Note>

In the example below, Fern will generate a method called `client.users.create()` for the `POST /users` endpoint.

```yaml title="openapi.yaml"
paths:
  /users:
    post:
      x-fern-sdk-group-name: users
      x-fern-sdk-method-name: create
```

## Top level methods

If you omit the `x-fern-sdk-group-name` extension, then the generated SDK method will live at the root.
In the example below, Fern will generate a method called `client.send()`:

```yaml title="openapi.yaml"
paths:
  /send:
    post:
      x-fern-sdk-method-name: send
```

## Multiple levels of nesting

If you add more than one `x-fern-sdk-group-name` extension, then the generated SDK will nest group names.
The order of the group names is preserved in the generated SDK method.

In the example below, Fern will generate a method called `client.users.notifications.send()`:

```yaml title="openapi.yaml"
paths:
  /users/notifications:
    post:
      x-fern-sdk-group-name:
        - users
        - notifications
      x-fern-sdk-method-name: send
```
