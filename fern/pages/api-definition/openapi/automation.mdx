subtitle: Pull your latest OpenAPI Specification into your Fern Folder automatically.
---

If you host your OpenAPI Specification at a publically available URL, you can have Fern programmatically fetch the latest spec on a preconfigured cadence. By default, this will be done every day and open a new PR on the GitHub repo that contains your Fern Folder. This feature requires installation of the [Fern GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/fern-api).

```yml title="generators.yml"

  specs:
    - openapi: openapi/openapi.json
      origin: https://example.com/openapi.json
```
