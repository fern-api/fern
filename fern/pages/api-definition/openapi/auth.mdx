title: Authentication
subtitle: Model auth schemes such as bearer, basic, and api key.
---

Configuring authentication schemes happens in the `components.securitySchemes` section of OpenAPI.

```yml
components: 
  securitySchemes: 
    ...
```

<Note>
To apply a security scheme across all endpoints, reference the `securityScheme` within the `security` section of your OpenAPI Specification. 

```yml title="openapi.yml" {3, 5-6}
components: 
  securitySchemes: 
    AuthScheme:
      ...
security: 
  - AuthScheme: []
```
</Note>

There are more things that you can integrate with.

## Bearer security scheme

Start by defining a `bearer` security scheme in your `openapi.yml`:

```yml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    BearerAuth:
      type: http
      scheme: bearer
```

This will generate an SDK where the user would have to provide a mandatory argument called `token`.

```ts
const client = new Client({
  token: "ey34..."
})
```

If you want to control variable naming and the environment variable to scan, use the configuration below:

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    BearerAuth:
      type: http
      scheme: bearer
      x-fern-bearer: 
        name: apiKey
        env: PLANTSTORE_API_KEY
```

The generated SDK would look like:

```ts

// Uses process.env.PLANTSTORE_API_KEY
let client = new Client(); 

// token has been renamed to apiKey
client = new Client({
  apiKey: "ey34..."
})
```

## Basic security scheme

Start by defining a `basic` security scheme in your `openapi.yml`:

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    BasicAuth:
      type: http
      scheme: basic
```

This will generate an SDK where the user would have to provide a mandatory arguments called `username` and `password`.

```ts
const client = new Client({
  username: "joeschmoe"
  password: "ey34..."
})
```

If you want to control variable naming and environment variables to scan, use the configuration below:

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    BasicAuth:
      type: http
      scheme: basic
      x-fern-basic:
        username:
          name: clientId
          env: PLANTSTORE_CLIENT_ID
        password:
          name: clientSecret
          env: PLANTSTORE_CLIENT_SECRET
```

The generated SDK would look like:

```ts

// Uses process.env.PLANTSTORE_CLIENT_ID and process.env.PLANTSTORE_CLIENT_SECRET
let client = new Client(); 

// parameters have been renamed
client = new Client({
  clientId: "joeschmoe", 
  clientSecret: "ey34..."
})
```

## ApiKey security scheme

Start by defining an `apiKey` security scheme in your `openapi.yml`:

```yml
components: 
  securitySchemes: 
    ApiKey: 
      type: apiKey
      in: header
      name: X_API_KEY
```

This will generate an SDK where the user would have to provide a mandatory argument called `apiKey`.

```ts
const client = new Client({
  apiKey: "ey34..."
})
```

If you want to control variable naming and environment variables to scan, use the configuration below:

```yaml
components: 
  securitySchemes: 
    ApiKey: 
      type: apiKey
      in: header
      name: X_API_KEY
      x-fern-header:
        name: apiToken
        env: PLANTSTORE_API_KEY
        prefix: "Token " # Optional      
```

The generated SDK would look like:

```ts

// Uses process.env.PLANTSTORE_API_KEY
let client = new Client(); 

// parameters have been renamed
client = new Client({
  apiToken: "ey34..."
})
```

## Multiple security schemes

If you would like to define multiple security schemes, simply list them under `components.securitySchemes`. For example, if you wanted to support `basic` and `apiKey` security schemes, see the example below:

```yaml
components: 
  securitySchemes: 
    BearerAuth:
      type: http
      scheme: bearer  
    ApiKey: 
      type: apiKey
      in: header
      name: X_API_KEY   
```
