OpenAPI allows you to specify one or more base URLs under the `servers` key.

```yml openapi.yml 

servers: 
  - https://api.yourcompany.com/
  - https://api.eu.yourcompany.com/
```

Specifying servers is valuable for both SDKs and Docs: 
- For SDKs, your users won't need to manually specify the baseURL at client instantiation
- For Docs, your API playground will automatically hit the correct server

## Naming your servers

If you have more than one server, we recommend specifying an `x-fern-server-name` to name 
the server. 

```yml openapi.yml {3,5}
servers: 
  - x-fern-server-name: Production
    url: https://api.yourcompany.com/
  - x-fern-server-name: Production_EU
    url: https://api.eu.yourcompany.com/
```

## Multiple Base URLs for a single API

If you have a microservice architecture, it is possible that you may have different endpoints hosted
at differnt URLs. For example, your AI endpoints might be hosted at `ai.yourcompany.com` and the rest 
of your endpoins might be hosted at `api.yourcompany.com`. 

To specify this, you will need to add configuration to both your `generators.yml` and OpenAPI spec. The 
snippet directly below shows how to configure an environment with multiple urls in your `generators.yml`. 

```yml generators.yml {3-8}
api: 
  default-environment: Production
  default-url: api
  environments: 
    Production: 
      api: api.yourcompany.com
      ai: ai.yourcompany.com
  specs: 
    - openapi: ./path/to/your/openapi
      overrides: ./path/to/your/overrides # optional
```

Once you've specified the environments in your `generators.yml`, you can use the `x-fern-server-name` 
extension to specify which server the operation belongs to. 

```yml openapi.yml {4}
paths: 
  /chat: 
    post: 
      x-fern-server-name: ai 
```

If you have multiple environments like development or staging, you can model those in your `generators.yml` 
as well. 

```yml generators.yml {7-12}
api: 
  default-environment: Production
  default-url: api
  environments: 
    Production: 
      api: api.yourcompany.com
      ai: ai.yourcompany.com
    Staging: 
      api: api.staging.yourcompany.com
      ai: ai.staging.yourcompany.com    
    Dev: 
      api: api.dev.yourcompany.com
      ai: ai.dev.yourcompany.com          
```
