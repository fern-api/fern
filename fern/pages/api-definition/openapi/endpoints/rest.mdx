subtitle: Document HTTP JSON APIs with the `application/json` content type

Endpoints in OpenAPI are defined underneath the `paths` key. Below is an example of defining 
a single endpoint: 

```yml title="openapi.yml" maxLines=0 {2-18}
paths:
  /pets:
    post:
      summary: Create a new pet
      description: Creates a new pet with the provided information
      requestBody:
        required: true
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/Pet'
      responses:
        '200':
          description: User created successfully
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Pet'
```

## Examples

You can provide examples of requests and responses by using the `examples` key.
