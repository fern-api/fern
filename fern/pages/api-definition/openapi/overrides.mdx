title: Overlay customizations on an existing OpenAPI spec
subtitle: Can't directly modify your OpenAPI spec? No worries, use an overrides file instead. 
---

If you generate your OpenAPI from server code, you may want to tweak your OpenAPI Spec without having to 
touch the generated file.  Fern supports this via an `overrides` file. 

<CodeGroup>
```yml openapi.yml
paths: 
 /users: 
   post: 
    description: Create a User
    operationId: users_post
    requestBody: 
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            $ref: '#/components/schemas/User'
```
```yml title="overrides.yml" {4-5}
paths: 
 /users: 
   post: 
    x-fern-sdk-group-name: users
    x-fern-sdk-method-name: create
```
```yml title="combined" {4-5}
paths: 
 /users/post: 
  post: 
    x-fern-sdk-group-name: users
    x-fern-sdk-method-name: create      
    description: Create a User
    operationId: users_post
    requestBody: 
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            $ref: '#/components/schemas/User'   
```
</CodeGroup>

## Configuration

Follow the steps below to configure your OpenAPI overrides: 

<Steps>
### Create an `overrides.yml` 

Simply create a yaml file and write down all the overrides you want to add: 

```yaml overrides.yml 
paths:
  /v1/history:
    get:
      x-fern-sdk-group-name:
        - history
      x-fern-sdk-method-name: get_all    
```

### Reference the file in your `generators.yml` 

```yml generators.yml
api: 
  specs:
    - openapi: ../openapi.yml
      overrides: ../overrides.yml 
```

<Note> The format of the overrides file is independent from the spec. For example, even if your OpenAPI spec is in JSON format, you can write the overrides in yaml. </Note>
