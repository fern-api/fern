title: Multipart File Upload
description: Document endpoints with the `multiform` content type.
---

Endpoints in Fern are defined underneath the `endpoints` key. If your endpoint request includes file uploads, you can use the `file` type to indicate the request is of a `multiform` content type. The example below demonstrates an endpoint which includes a file in the request body. 

<CodeBlock title="document.yml">
```yaml {12}
service:
  base-path: /documents
  auth: false
  endpoints:
    uploadDocument:
      path: /upload
      method: POST
      request:
        name: UploadDocumentRequest
        body:
          properties:
            file: file
```
</CodeBlock>

Within a given multipart request, a string parameter with `format:binary` will represent an arbitrary file.

## List of Files

If your endpoint supports a list of files, then your request body must indicate such.

<CodeBlock title="document.yml">
```yaml {12}
service:
  base-path: /documents
  auth: false
  endpoints:
    uploadDocuments:
      path: /upload
      method: POST
      request:
        name: UploadDocumentsRequest
        body:
          properties:
            files: list<file>
```
</CodeBlock>
