Configuring authentication schemes happens in the `api.yml` file. NEW

```bash {5}
fern/
├─ fern.config.json # root-level configuration
├─ generators.yml # generators you're using
└─ definition/
  ├─ api.yml  # API-level configuration
  └─ imdb.yml # endpoints, types, and errors
```

To add an authentication scheme, specify the authentication method under the `auth-schemes` section.

```yaml api.yml {1-2}
auth-schemes:
  AuthScheme:                     
    ...
```

<Note>
To apply an authentication scheme across all endpoints, reference the `auth-scheme` within the `auth` section of your `api.yml` file. 
```yaml api.yml {1}
auth: AuthScheme                  
auth-schemes:
  AuthScheme:                     
    ...
```
</Note>

## Bearer authentication

Start by defining a `Bearer` authentication scheme in `api.yml`:

```yaml api.yml
auth: Bearer                  
auth-schemes:
  Bearer:                     
    scheme: bearer
```

This will generate an SDK where the user would have to provide a mandatory argument called `token`.

```ts index.ts
const client = new Client({
  token: "ey34..."
})
```

If you want to control variable naming and the environment variable to scan, use the configuration below:

```yaml title="api.yml" {5-7}
auth: Bearer                  
auth-schemes:
  Bearer:                     
    scheme: bearer
    token:
      name: apiKey 
      env: PLANTSTORE_API_KEY
```

The generated SDK would look like:

```ts index.ts

// Uses process.env.PLANTSTORE_API_KEY
let client = new Client(); 

// token has been renamed to apiKey
client = new Client({
  apiKey: "ey34..."
})
```

## Basic authentication

Start by defining a `Basic` authentication scheme in `api.yml`:

```yaml api.yml
auth: Basic                  
auth-schemes:
  Basic:                     
    scheme: basic
```

This will generate an SDK where the user would have to provide a mandatory arguments called `username` and `password`.

```ts index.ts
const client = new Client({
  username: "joeschmoe"
  password: "ey34..."
})
```

If you want to control variable naming and environment variables to scan, use the configuration below:

```yaml title="api.yml" {5-11}
auth: Basic                  
auth-schemes:
  Basic:                     
    scheme: basic
    username:
      name: clientId
      env: PLANTSTORE_CLIENT_ID
    password:
      name: clientSecret
      env: PLANTSTORE_CLIENT_SECRET
```

The generated SDK would look like:

```ts index.ts

// Uses process.env.PLANTSTORE_CLIENT_ID and process.env.PLANTSTORE_CLIENT_SECRET
let client = new Client(); 

// parameters have been renamed
client = new Client({
  clientId: "joeschmoe", 
  clientSecret: "ey34..."
})
```

## Custom header (e.g. API key)

You can also create your own authentication scheme with customized headers.

```yaml title="api.yml" {3-5}
auth: ApiKeyAuthScheme
auth-schemes:
  ApiKeyAuthScheme:
    header: X-API-Key
    type: string
```

This will generate an SDK where the user would have to provide a mandatory argument called `apiKey`.

```ts index.ts
const client = new Client({
  xApiKey: "ey34..."
})
```

If you want to control variable naming and environment variables to scan, use the configuration below:

```yaml title="api.yml" {7-8}
auth: ApiKeyAuthScheme
auth-schemes:
  ApiKeyAuthScheme:
    header: X-API-Key
    type: string
    name: apiKey
    env: PLANTSTORE_API_KEY
```

The generated SDK would look like:

```ts index.ts

// Uses process.env.PLANTSTORE_API_KEY
let client = new Client(); 

// parameters have been renamed
client = new Client({
  apiKey: "ey34..."
})
```

## OAuth client credentials

If your API uses OAuth, you can specify an oauth scheme. Note that you'll need to define a token retrieval endpoint.

```yaml api.yml
name: api

imports:
  auth: auth.yml

auth: OAuthScheme
auth-schemes:
  OAuthScheme:
    scheme: oauth
    type: client-credentials
    client-id-env: YOUR_CLIENT_ID
    client-secret-env: YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
    get-token:
      endpoint: auth.getToken               
      response-properties:
        access-token: $response.access_token 
        expires-in: $response.expires_in    

```

If the `expires-in` property is set, the generated OAuth token provider will automatically refresh the token when it expires. Otherwise, it's assumed that the access token is valid indefinitely.

With this, all of the OAuth logic happens automatically in the generated SDKs. As long as you configure these settings, your client will automatically retrieve an access token and refresh it as needed.

When using the docs playground, `token-header` and `token-prefix` can optionally be set to customize the header key name and header value prefix, to match the expected format of the API auth scheme.

For example, the following would produce a header `Fern-Authorization: Fern-Bearer <token>`:

```yaml api.yml {5-6}
auth-schemes:
  OAuthScheme:
    scheme: oauth
    type: client-credentials
    token-header: Fern-Authorization
    token-prefix: Fern-Bearer
    get-token:
      ...   
```
