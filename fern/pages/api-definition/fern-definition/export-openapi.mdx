title: Export from Fern Definition to OpenAPI
description: Export your Fern Definition files to OpenAPI using Fern's OpenAPI generator.
---

To prevent lock-in to the Fern Definition format, we provide a generator that will export your Fern Def files to OpenAPI 3.1. 
This lets you switch to using OpenAPI at any time, or use your API definition with OpenAPI tools.
To convert your Fern Definition to OpenAPI, use the `fern-openapi` generator. 

Update your `generators.yml` file:

<CodeBlock title="generators.yml">
```yaml
- name: fernapi/fern-openapi
  version: 0.1.7
  config:
    format: yaml # options are yaml or json
  output:
    location: local-file-system
    path: ../openapi # relative path to output location
```
</CodeBlock>
