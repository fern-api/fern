Types describe the data model of your API.

## Built-in types

- `string`
- `integer`
- `long`
- `double`
- `boolean`
- `datetime` _An [RFC 3339, section 5.6 datetime](https://ijmacd.github.io/rfc3339-iso8601/). For example, `2017-07-21T17:32:28Z`._
- `date` _An RFC 3339, section 5.6 date (YYYY-MM-DD). For example, `2017-07-21`._
- `uuid`
- `base64`
- `list` _e.g., list\<string\>_
- `set` _e.g., set\<string\>_
- `map` _e.g., map\<string, integer\>_
- `optional` _e.g., optional\<string\>_
- `literal` _e.g., literal\<"Plants"\>_
- `unknown` _Represents arbitrary JSON._

## Custom types

Creating your own types is easy in Fern!

### Objects

The most common custom types are **objects**.

In Fern, you use the `"properties"` key to create an object:

```yaml {3,8}
types:
  Person:
    properties: # <---
      name: string
      address: Address

  Address:
    properties: # <---
      line1: string
      line2: optional<string>
      city: string
      state: string
      zip: string
      country: literal<"USA">
```

These represent JSON objects:

```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "address": {
    "line1": "123 Happy Lane",
    "city": "New York",
    "state": "NY",
    "zip": "10001",
    "country": "USA"
  }
}
```

You can also use **extends** to compose objects:

```yaml {6}
types:
  Pet:
    properties:
      name: string
  Dog:
    extends: Pet
    properties:
      breed: string
```

You can extend multiple objects:

```yaml {3-5}
types:
  GoldenRetriever:
    extends:
      - Dog
      - Pet
    properties:
      isGoodBoy: boolean
```

### Aliases

An Alias type is a renaming of an existing type. This is usually done for clarity.

```yaml
types:
  # UserId is an alias of string
  UserId: string

  User:
    properties:
      id: UserId
      name: string
```

### Enums

An enum represents a string with a set of allowed values.

In Fern, you use the `"enum"` key to create an enum:

```yaml
types:
  WeatherReport:
    enum: # <---
      - SUNNY
      - CLOUDY
      - RAINING
      - SNOWING
```

Enum names are restricted to `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, and `_` to ensure that generated code can compile across all of the languages that Fern can output. If you have an enum that doesn't follow this convention, you can use the `"name"` key to specify a custom name:

```yaml
types:
  Operator:
    enum:
      - name: LESS_THAN # <--- the name that will be used in SDKs
        value: < # <--- the value that will be serialized
      - name: GREATER_THAN
        value: >
      - name: NOT_EQUAL
        value: !=
```

### Unions

Fern supports tagged unions (a.k.a. discriminated unions). Unions are useful for
polymorphism. This is similar to the `oneOf` concept in OpenAPI.

In Fern, you use the `"union"` key to create an union:

```yaml {3-5}
types:
  Animal:
    union:
      dog: Dog
      cat: Cat
  Dog:
    properties:
      likesToWoof: boolean
  Cat:
    properties:
      likesToMeow: boolean
```

In JSON, unions have a **discriminant property** to differentiate between
different members of the union. By default, Fern uses `"type"` as the
discriminant property:

```json
{
  "type": "dog",
  "likesToWoof": true
}
```

You can customize the discriminant property using the "discriminant" key:

```diff {3}
 types:
   Animal:
+    discriminant: animalType
     union:
       dog: Dog
       cat: Cat
   Dog:
     properties:
       likesToWoof: boolean
   Cat:
     properties:
       likesToMeow: boolean
```

This corresponds to a JSON object like this:

```json
{
  "animalType": "dog",
  "likesToWoof": true
}
```

You can also have a union without a discriminant.

```
MyUnion:
  discriminated: false
  union:
    - string
    - integer
```

### Documenting types

You can add documentation for types. These docs are passed into the compiler,
and are incredibly useful in the generated outputs (e.g., docstrings in SDKs).

<CodeBlock title="Fern Definition">
```yaml
types:
  Person:
    docs: A person represents a human being
    properties:
      name: string
      age:
        docs: age in years
        type: integer
```
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock title="Generated TypeScript SDK from Fern Definition">
```typescript 
/**
 * A person represents a human being
 */
interface Person {
  name: string;
  // age in years
  age: number;
}
```
</CodeBlock>
