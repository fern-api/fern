title: Environments
description: List environments like production, staging, and development.

You can specify the environments where your server is deployed. 

## Single URL environments

<CodeBlock title="api.yml">
```yaml
name: api
environments:
  Production: https://www.yoursite.com
  Staging:
    docs: This staging environment is helpful for testing!
    url: https://www.staging.yoursite.com
```
</CodeBlock>

## Multiple URLs per environment

You can specify multiple URLs per environment. This is helpful if you have a
microservice architecture, and you want a single SDK to interact with multiple
servers.

<CodeBlock title="api.yml">
```yaml
environments:
  Production:
    urls:
      Auth: https://auth.yoursite.com
      Plants: https://plants.yoursite.com
  Staging:
    urls:
      Auth: https://auth.staging.yoursite.com
      Plants: https://plants.staging.yoursite.com
```
</CodeBlock>

If you choose to use this feature, you must specify a `url` for each service you define:

<CodeBlock title="auth.yml">
```yaml
service:
  url: Auth
  base-path: /auth
  ...
```
</CodeBlock>

## Default environment

You can also provide a default environment:

<CodeBlock title="api.yml">
```yaml
name: api
environments:
  Production: https://www.yoursite.com
  Staging:
    docs: This staging environment is helpful for testing!
    url: https://www.staging.yoursite.com
default-environment: Production
```
</CodeBlock>

<Note> By providing a default environment, the generated SDK will be setup to hit that URL out-of-the-box. </Note>

## Base path
If you would like all of your endpoints to be prefixed with a path, use `base-path`. 

In the example below, every endpoint is prefixed with a `/v1`: 
```yaml api.yml
name: api
base-path: /v1
```

## Audiences

If you have listed environments that you want to filter, you can leverage audiences. 

<CodeBlock title="api.yml">
```yaml 
audiences:
  - public

environments:
  Dev: 
    url: https://dev.com
  Prod: 
    url: https://rewards-api.getkard.com
    audiences:
      - external
```
</CodeBlock>
