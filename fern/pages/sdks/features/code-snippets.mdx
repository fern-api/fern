Fern generates code snippets of how to consume the SDK in various languages. 
These code snippets are embedded in a variety of different locations:

### Snippets in the SDK
Each SDK contains code snippets so that users can see usage examples 
on hover. See examples below: 

<CodeBlocks>
  <CodeBlock title="TypeScript">
    ```typescript focus={6-11} maxLines=0
    export interface MovieClient {
      /**
       * Create a new movie
       * @param request: a request to create a movie
       * 
       * @example
       * const response = await client.movie.create({
       *  title: 'Inception',
       *  year: 2010,
       *  director: 'Christopher Nolan'
       * });
       */
      create(request: CreateMovieRequest): Promise<CreateMovieResponse>; 
    }
    ```
  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock title="Python">
    ```python focus={18-25} maxLines=0
    class MovieClient:

      def create(
        self, 
        *,
        title: str,
        year: int,
        director: str
      ) -> CreateMovieResponse: 
          """
          Create a new movie
          
          Parameters: 
            - title: str. The title of the movie.
            - year: int. The year the movie was released.
            - director: str. The director of the movie.
          ---
          from imdb.client import Imdb
          
          client = Imdb()
          response = client.movie.create(
            title='Inception',
            year=2010,
            director='Christopher Nolan'
          )
          """
    ```
  </CodeBlock>
</CodeBlocks>

### Snippets in Documentation
If you use Fern to generate your developer documentation, then you can configure the code 
snippets to be automatically populated in your documentation.

### Snippets over API
We also provide a public API that you can use to [fetch code snippets](/learn/cli-api/api-reference/snippets/get). This is useful if you
want to display code snippets in your own documentation or website.
