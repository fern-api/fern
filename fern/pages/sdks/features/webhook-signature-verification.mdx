title: Webhook Signature Verification
description: Verify the signature of incoming webhook requests
---

<Warning title='Pro Feature'>
  This feature is only available on paid plans. Please schedule a [demo](https://buildwithfern.com/contact) 
  or [email us](mailto:support@buildwithfern.com) to get started. 
</Warning>

Fern's SDKs export helper function to verify the signature of incoming webhook requests. 
There are three benefits to using this feature:
1. **Security**: Users can ensure that the incoming webhook request is from your server.
2. **Ease of Use**: Instead of making consumers write signature verification logic, you can use the SDK's helper function.
3. **Strongly Typed**: The SDK will parse the incoming payload and return a strongly typed object.

Each SDK exports a `constructEvent` function that takes in the incoming payload and the signature. The 
function will return a strongly typed object that represents the incoming webhook event.
