title: Idiomatic Method Names
description: Fine-tune SDK resources and method names
---

Fern allows you to fine-tune your SDK method and group names so that 
your SDK reads exactly how you want it to. For example, instead of 
`client.postUsers` you can configure the SDK to read `client.users.create()`.

<CodeBlocks>
  <CodeBlock title="TypeScript">
    ```ts
    const response = await client.users.create();
    ```
  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock title="Python">
    ```python
    response = client.users.create()
    # or async 
    response = await async_client.users.create()
    ```
  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock title="Java">
    ```java
    const response = client.users().create();
    ```
  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock title="Go">
    ```go
    const response = client.Users.Create();
    ```
  </CodeBlock>
</CodeBlocks>

Groups can also be arbitrarily nested. For example, if you want to nest the `users` 
endpoints under an `admin` group, the SDK would then read: 

<CodeBlocks>
  <CodeBlock title="TypeScript">
    ```ts
    const response = await client.admin.users.create();
    ```
  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock title="Python">
    ```python
    response = client.admin.users.create()
    # or async 
    response = await async_client.amdin.users.create()
    ```
  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock title="Java">
    ```java
    const response = client.admin().users().create();
    ```
  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock title="Go">
    ```go
    const response = client.Admin.Users.Create();
    ```
  </CodeBlock>
</CodeBlocks>

<Note>
See how merge.dev uses nested groups [here](https://github.com/merge-api/merge-node-client?tab=readme-ov-file#create-link-token). 
</Note>

If you're using an OpenAPI spec, you'll need to leverage the [`x-fern-sdk-method-name`](/learn/api-definition/openapi/extensions#sdk-method-names)
extension. If you're using the fern definition, then the method name comes from the endpoint directly. 

## Casing

Additionally, Fern handles choosing the appropriate casing for each SDK 
language: `snake_case` in python, `camelCase` in TypeScript and `PascalCase` in Go, etc.
