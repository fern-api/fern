Fern supports the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework as a first class citizen. With Fern, users don't need
to retrieve and manage access tokens manually. Instead, Fern SDKs will handle the entire OAuth flow.

For the `client-credentials` OAuth flow, the user simply provides their `client-id` and `client-secret`,
and they're ready to go.

<Tab title="TypeScript">

  When OAuth is configured, the TypeScript SDK's client constructor will include the `clientId` and
  `clientSecret` parameters.

  Constructing the client is as simple as:
  ```typescript Client.ts
  client = new Client({
    clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
    clientSecret: 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET',
  });
  ```

  Behind the scenes, the `core.OAuthTokenProvider` retrieves an access token and refreshes it as needed. With this,
  the rest of the API (like the `User` client) can use the token to authenticate every request.

  When OAuth is configured, the Python SDK's client constructor will include the `client_id` and
  `client_secret` parameters.

  Constructing the client is as simple as:
  ```python client.py
  client = Client(
    client_id="YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    client_secret="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
  )
  ```

  Behind the scenes, the `core.OAuthTokenProvider` retrieves an access token and refreshes it as needed. With this,
  the rest of the API (like the `UserClient`) can use the token to authenticate every request.

<Tab title="Java">

  When OAuth is configured, the Java SDK’s builder methods for setting the `clientId` and `clientSecret` are available.

  Constructing the client is as simple as:
  ```java client.java
  Client client = Client.builder()
      .clientId("YOUR_CLIENT_ID")
      .clientSecret("YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET")
      .build();
  ```

  Behind the scenes, the `core.OAuthTokenProvider` retrieves an access token and refreshes it as needed. With this,
  the rest of the API (like the `UserClient`) can use the token to authenticate every request.

### Supported Authorization Flows

Fern supports the following OAuth authorization flows:
