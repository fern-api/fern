title: Discriminated Unions
description: Fern SDKs include idiomatic support for discriminated unions
---

The SDKs natively support discriminated [unions](../../api-definition/fern/types#unions) for both OpenAPI and Fern APIs.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Fern definition">
Discriminated unions are defined with the `union` key. For example, a simple
`Shape` type that can either be a `Triangle` or a `Square` can be defined as follows:

<CodeBlock title="fern/definition/shape.yml">
  ```yaml
  types:
    Shape:
    union:
      triangle: Triangle
      square: Square

  Triangle:
    properties:
      a: double
      b: double
      c: double

  Square:
    properties:
      side: double
  ```
</CodeBlock>

With this, the JSON representation for a `Shape` looks like the following:

<CodeBlock title="triangle.json">
  ```json
  {
    "type": "triangle",
    "a": 3,
    "b": 4,
    "c": 5
  }
  ```
</CodeBlock>

or

<CodeBlock title="square.json">
  ```json
  {
    "type": "sqaure",
    "side": 5
  }
  ```
</CodeBlock>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="OpenAPI spec">
Discriminated unions are defined with the `oneOf` and `anyOf` keys. For example, consider
the following `Shape` definition:

<CodeBlock title="openapi.yml">
  ```yaml
  components:
    schemas:
      Shape:
        oneOf:
          - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Triangle"
          - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Square"
      Triangle:
        type: object
        properties:
          type:
            type: string
            enum:
              - triangle
          a:
            type: number
          b:
            type: number
          c:
            type: number
        required:
          - type
          - a
          - b
          - c
      Square:
        type: object
        properties:
          type:
            type: string
            enum:
              - square
          side:
            type: number
        required:
          - type
          - side
  ```
</CodeBlock>

With this, the JSON representation for a `Shape` looks like the following:

<CodeBlock title="triangle.json">
  ```json
  {
    "type": "triangle",
    "a": 3,
    "b": 4,
    "c": 5
  }
  ```
</CodeBlock>

or

<CodeBlock title="square.json">
  ```json
  {
    "type": "sqaure",
    "side": 5
  }
  ```
</CodeBlock>

```ts maxLines=0 {1}
export type Shape = Triangle | Square;

export interface Triangle {
  type: "triangle";
  a: number;
  b: number;
  c: number;
}

export interface Square {
  type: "square";
  side: number;
}
```

Callers can create a `Shape` object by simply constructing the appropriate type. For example, creating
a `Triangle` shape looks like the following:

```ts
const shape: Shape = {
  type: "triangle",
  a: 3,
  b: 4,
  c: 5,
};
```

Consumers can easily write branching logic by checking the discriminant.

```ts {4, 6}
import { Shape } from "sdk";

export function computeArea(shape: Shape): number {
  if (shape.type === "triangle") {
    // compute triangle area
  } else if (shape.type === "square") {
    // compute square area
  }
}
```

<Tab title="Go">

Go does not have a built-in support for discriminated unions. However, you can define a union struct
to achieve the same effect:

```go maxLines=0 {1-5}
type Shape struct {
	Type     string
	Triangle *Triangle
	Square   *Square
}

type Triangle struct {
	A float64 `json:"a" url:"a"`
	B float64 `json:"b" url:"b"`
	C float64 `json:"c" url:"c"`
}

type Square struct {
	Side float64 `json:"side" url:"side"`
}
```

Callers can create a `Shape` object by simply setting the appropriate key. For example, creating
a `Triangle` shape looks like the following:

```go
shape := &Shape{
  // You do not need to set the Type field manually, the SDK will automatically set it for you.
  Triangle: &Triangle{
    A: 3,
    B: 4,
    C: 5,
  },
}
```

Consumers can easily write a `switch` statement by checking the discriminant:

```go {3, 5}
func ComputeArea(shape *Shape) float64 {
  switch shape.Type {
  case "triangle":
    // compute triangle area
  case "square":
    // compute square areair
  }
}
```
