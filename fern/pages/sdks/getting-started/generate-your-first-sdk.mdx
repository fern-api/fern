description: Use Fern's CLI tool to generate your first SDK.

<Warning title='Schedule a Demo'>
  Generating SDKs often requires understanding the state of your OpenAPI spec as well as 
  your specific requirements. For the ideal experience, we **strongly recommend** scheduling a 
  [demo](https://buildwithfern.com/contact) or [emailing us](mailto:support@buildwithfern.com) to get started. 
</Warning>

If you'd rather get started immediately, you can use Fern's CLI tool 
to generate your first SDK.

<Steps>
  ### Install the Fern CLI

  First, install the CLI tool by running the following command:

  ```bash
  npm install -g fern-api
  ```

  ### Initialize the Fern Folder

  <AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="OpenAPI">
      If you have an OpenAPI spec, you can initialize the Fern folder by running the following command:

      ```bash
      fern init --openapi path/to/openapi.yml
      ```
      
      If your OpenAPI spec is hosted on the web, you can use the URL:

      ```bash
      fern init --openapi https://api.example.com/openapi.yml
      ```

      This will create a `fern` folder in your current directory with the OpenAPI spec.

      ```sh
      fern/
        ├─ fern.config.json # root-level configuration
        └─ api/ # your API
          ├─ generators.yml # generators you're using
          └─ openapi/
            ├─ openapi.yml  # API-level configuration
      ```
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Fern Definition">
      If you'd like to use the Fern Definition, you can initialize the Fern folder 
      by running the following command:

      ```bash
      fern init
      ```

      This will create a `fern` folder in your current directory with the Fern Definition.

      ```sh
      fern/
        ├─ fern.config.json # root-level configuration
        └─ api/ # your API
          ├─ generators.yml # generators you're using
          └─ definition/
            ├─ api.yml  # API-level configuration
            └─ imdb.yml # endpoints, types, and errors
      ```

    </Accordion>
  </AccordionGroup>

  ### Pass `fern check`

  Run `fern check` to ensure that your API Definition is valid. If there are any errors,
  you will need to fix them before proceeding.

  <Note>
    If you're using an OpenAPI spec, check out all of our 
    [supported extensions](/learn/api-definition/openapi/extensions).
  </Note>

  ### Add the SDK Generator

  <Warning title='Pro Features'>
    By default, none of the pro features will be enabled. 
  </Warning>

  You can now use the SDK in your application. Here's an example of how 
  you can use the SDK:

  <CodeBlocks>
    <CodeBlock title="TypeScript">
      ```sh
      fern add fern-typescript-node-sdk --group sdk
      ```
    </CodeBlock>
    <CodeBlock title="Python">
      ```sh
      fern add fern-python-sdk --group sdk
      ```
    </CodeBlock>
    <CodeBlock title="Java">
      ```sh
      fern add fern-java-sdk --group sdk
      ```
    </CodeBlock>
    <CodeBlock title="Go">
      ```sh
      fern add fern-go-sdk --group sdk
      ```
    </CodeBlock>
    <CodeBlock title="Ruby">
      ```sh
      fern add fern-ruby-sdk --group sdk
      ```
    </CodeBlock>
  </CodeBlocks>

  ### Run `fern generate --group sdk`

  Next up, run the following command to generate the SDK:

  ```bash
  fern generate --group sdk
  ```

  This will create a `fern` folder in your current directory with the Fern 
  Definition. For example, if you're generating a TypeScript SDK, the folder structure
  will look like this:

  ```sh
  sdks/
    typescript/
      src/
        ├─ index.ts
        ├─ Client.ts
        └─ api
        └─ errors   
        └─ serialization   
  ```
  
</Steps>
