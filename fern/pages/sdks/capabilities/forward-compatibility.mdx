description: SDKs that are fault-tolerant as your API evolves

Fern SDKs are designed so that you can evolve your API without breaking users on 
legacy SDKs. You can safely add additional response properties, enum values, and union variants. 
The legacy SDKs will safely handle deserializing extra information.

  ### Additional Response Properties
  As you make new response properties available, 
  the legacy SDKs will continue to work. For example, let's say you 
  generated an SDK that had the following `Movie` object: 
  ```ts
  export interface Movie {
    name: string;
    id: string;
  }
  ```

  If you decided to add a new `genre` property on your server, the SDK will 
  simply pass the extra property back. Users would also be able to access
  the property by doing

  ```ts
  const genre = movie['genre'];
  ```

  ### Additional Enum values
  As you add additional enum properties on your server, the 
  legacy SDKs will continue to work. For example, let's say your generated SDK 
  had the following `Genre` type: 

  ```ts
  export type Genre =
    | "horror"
    | "action"
    | "thriller"
    | "drama";
  ```

  If you decided to add a new enum value `comedy`, the SDK will simply pass 
  the string value back to the user. The consumer can then handle this case
  in the default case of a switch statement.

  ```ts {6-7}
  switch(genre) {
    case "horror": 
    case "action": 
    case "thriller": 
    case "drama": 
    default: 
      console.log(genre); // prints out comedy
  }
  ```

  ### Additional union variants
  Similar to additional enum properties, if you add additional union types 
  on your server, the legacy SDKs will continue to work. For example, let's say your 
  generated SDK had the following `Shape` type: 

  ```ts
  export type Shape = Square | Circle;

  export interface Circle {
    type: "circle",
    radius: number
  }

  export interface Square {
    type: "square",
    side: number
  }
  ```

  If you decided to add an additional union type called `Triangle` 

  ```ts
  + export type Shape = Square | Circle | Triangle;

  + export interface Triangle {
  +   type: "triangle",
  +   a: number
  +   b: number
  +   c: number
  + }
  ```
  
  then the user could simply handle the unknown case in their legacy SDK. 
  ```ts {6-7}
  switch (type) {
    case "circle": 
      ...
    case "square": 
      ...
    default: 
      console.log(type); // prints out triangle
  }
  ```
