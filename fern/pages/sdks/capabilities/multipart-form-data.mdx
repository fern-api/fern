description: SDKs that handle multipart form data
---

Fern generated SDKs natively support uploading files and other media through 
multipart form data uploads. 

<Tabs>
<Tab title="TypeScript" language="typescript">
  The TypeScript SDK will accept either a `fs.readStream`, `fs.ReadableStream` or a 
  `Blob` for the file types. This is to ensure that the file upload functionality 
  can be used in the browser, Node.js and edge runtimes like Next.js and Cloudflare. 

  This is what the SDK method signature would look like: 
  ```ts DocumentClient.ts
  export interface DocumentClient {
    
    /**
     * Upload a document.
     */
    public async upload(
        contents: fs.ReadStream | fs.ReadableStream | Blob,
        request: UploadDocumentBodyRequest,
        requestOptions?: RequestOptions
    ): Promise<UploadDocumentResponse>  
  }
  ```
  and how a user would consume it
  ```ts
  await client.documents.upload(fs.createReadStream('/path/to/your/file.txt'), {
    label: 'Human-friendly label for your document',
  });
  ```
