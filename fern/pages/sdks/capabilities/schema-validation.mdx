title: Schema validation
description: Fail-fast if the payloads diverge from your schema
---

Often times, your API Definition may drift from your server implementation. 
If you are concerned about this, you can toggle on schema validation in the 
SDKs. 

It's worth nothing that this feature is **optional** for duck-typed
languages like Python, TypeScript, and Ruby. However, for strongly typed 
languages like Go, Java, and C# this is always on.

  The TypeScript SDK contains a `serialization` folder when generated. 

  ``` {5}
  src/
    api/
    core/
    errors/
    serialization/
    Client.ts
    index.ts
  ```

  Inside of this serialization folder, are [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod)-like schemas for every 
  generated model. 

  For example, if you had a `Movie` schema defined in your API Definition and 
  wanted to validate the schema, you could simply do: 

  ```ts
  import { Movie } from "@my-company/sdk";
  import * as serializers from "@my-company/sdk/serialization";

  const movie: Movie = {
    name: "GoodwillHunting";
  }
  // serialize 
  serializers.Movie.jsonOrThrow(movie);
  // deserialize
  serializers.Movie.parseOrThrow({ "name": "Goodwill Hunting" });
  ```

  Fern allows you to generate the SDK in three different modes: 
    1. **No validation**: In this mode, there is no serialization layer generated. Types exist at 
       compile time, but they are completely removed at runtime. 
    2. **Request validation only**: In this mode, the serialization layer is only used to 
       validate requests. Responses are always returned even if they do not match the schema. This is
       the recommended mode for public API companies. 
    3. **Full validation**: In this mode, the serialization layer is used to validate both 
       requests and responses. This is the recommended mode for internal SDKs so that you can catch 
       issues as soon as possible.
