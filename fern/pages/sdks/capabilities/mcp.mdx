<Note>
The MCP generator is in development. Interested in offering a MCP Server for your API? Reach out via Slack or support@buildwithfern.com.
</Note>

[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) is an open protocol developed by Anthropic that allows you to provide tools to AI agents. MCP is in the early days of adoption with clients like Cursor, Claude Desktop App, and Windsurf. Our MCP generator allows you to augment your TypeScript SDK with an MCP server that's included in the generated SDK.

## Example: Webflow

Check out Webflow's MCP Server on [GitHub](https://github.com/webflow/mcp-server) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webflow-mcp-server). The Webflow MCP Server is built [leveraging Webflow's TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/webflow/mcp-server/blob/992b242fc1244f6ebb4099dc01e6cca8a228733d/src/index.ts#L28-L34).
