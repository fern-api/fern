<Note>
The MCP generator is in development. Interested in offering an MCP server for your API? Reach out via Slack or¬†support@buildwithfern.com.
</Note>

[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) is an open standard by Anthropic that streamlines how AI applications connect with external data sources and tools, enabling AI agents to directly use your product‚Äôs APIs.

A ‚ÄúBuilt with Fern‚Äù MCP server augments your existing TypeScript SDK with MCP capabilities and integrates seamlessly with popular AI-powered tools including Cursor, Claude Desktop, and Windsurf. You can find a full list of MCP clients [here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients).

## How it works

**Fern can build a production-ready MCP server on top of your existing TypeScript SDK.** We maintain the package in its own `git` repository, making it easy for your existing developer community to discover and contribute to the project. We can also automatically publish new versions of the package to `npm` for you.

End users of a ‚ÄúBuilt with Fern‚Äù MCP server can typically get started with a **single config**:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "<your-company>": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [ "-y", "<your-company>-mcp-server@latest" ]
    }
  }
}

```

## Case study: Webflow

**We worked with Webflow to launch their [official MCP server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webflow-mcp-server)** using the existing [Fern-generated TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/webflow/js-webflow-api).

Check out the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/webflow/mcp-server) and read the announcement from Webflow‚Äôs CTO on X:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">üö¢ We just launched our Webflow MCP server! Check out Allan‚Äôs thread to learn more, watch the demo video below, then give it a try here: <a href="https://t.co/T2K3OpJ6O8">https://t.co/T2K3OpJ6O8</a> <a href="https://t.co/bFUfC64pcf">https://t.co/bFUfC64pcf</a> <a href="https://t.co/oonYuyjHiT">pic.twitter.com/oonYuyjHiT</a></p>&mdash; Webflow (@webflow) <a href="https://twitter.com/webflow/status/1907465818088054843?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
