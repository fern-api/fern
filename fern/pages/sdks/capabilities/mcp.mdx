The MCP generator is in development. Interested in offering an MCP server for your API? Reach out via Slack or support@buildwithfern.com.
</Note>

[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) is an open standard by Anthropic that streamlines how AI applications connect with external data sources and tools, enabling AI agents to directly use your product’s APIs.

A “Built with Fern” MCP server augments your existing TypeScript SDK with MCP capabilities and integrates seamlessly with popular AI-powered tools including Cursor, Claude Desktop, and Windsurf. You can find a full list of MCP clients [here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients).

## How it works

**Fern can build a production-ready MCP server on top of your existing TypeScript SDK.** We maintain the package in its own `git` repository, making it easy for your existing developer community to discover and contribute to the project. We can also automatically publish new versions of the package to `npm` for you.

End users of a “Built with Fern” MCP server can typically get started with a **single config**:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "<your-company>": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [ "-y", "<your-company>-mcp-server@latest" ]
    }
  }
}

```

## Case study: Webflow

**We worked with Webflow to launch their [official MCP server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webflow-mcp-server)** using the existing [Fern-generated TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/webflow/js-webflow-api).

Read the [announcement from Webflow’s CTO on X](https://x.com/leinwand/status/1907463599762870383) and check out the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/webflow/mcp-server).
