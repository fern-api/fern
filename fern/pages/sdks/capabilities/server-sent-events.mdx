description: Stream JSON data from your server to your client (i.e. chat completions)

Fern's SDKs support Server-Sent Events (SSE) out of the box. This feature is 
especially relevant for chat completions, where you want to stream LLM 
outputs in real-time.

<Tab title="TypeScript" language="typescript">
    When an endpoint is configured to use Server-Sent Events, the TypeScript SDK 
    method will return an `AsyncIterable` of the underlying data type. This 
    allows you to use it in a `for await` loop.
  
    Below is an example method signature for a stream endpoint: 

    ```ts ChatClient.ts {10-13}
    import core from "../core";
  
    export interface ChatClient {
  
      /**
      * Stream chat completions
      * @param props 
      * @returns An async iterable of chat completions
      */
      stream(
        request: ChatStreamRequest, 
        requestOptions: core.RequestOptions = {}
      ): AsyncIterable<ChatCompletion>;
    }
    ```
    
    And here is an example of how a user would use the `stream` method:
    
    ```ts
    const response = await client.chat.stream({
      query: "What is the weather in New York?"
    });
    for await (const completion of response) {
      console.log(completion);
    }
    ```

<Tab title="Python" language="python">
    When an endpoint is configured to use Server-Sent Events, the Python SDK 
    method will return an `typing.Iterator` of the underlying data type.
  
    Below is an example method signature for a chat endpoint: 

    ```py chat_client.py {5-10}
    from fern import core
  
    class ChatClient:
  
      def stream(
        self, 
        *, 
        query: str,
        request_options: typing.Optional[RequestOptions]
      ) -> typing.Iterator[StreamedChatResponse]:
        pass
    ```

    And here is an example of how a user would use the `stream` method:
  
    ```py
    response = client.chat.stream(
      query = "What is the weather in New York?",
    )
    for completion in response:
      print(completion)
    ```

    ### Async client

    The Python SDK will also export an asynchronous version of the client. The async client
    will return an `AsyncIterator` instead of a regular iterator.

    ```py chat_client.py {5-10}
    from fern import core
  
    class ChatClient:
  
      def stream(
        self, 
        *, 
        query: str,
        request_options: typing.Optional[RequestOptions]
      ) -> typing.AsyncIterator[StreamedChatResponse]:
        pass
    ```

    And here is an example of how a user would use the async `stream` method:
  
    ```py
    import asyncio

    async def main(): 
      response = await client.chat.stream(
        query = "What is the weather in New York?",
      )
      async for completion in response:
        print(completion)
    
    asyncio.run(main())
    ```
