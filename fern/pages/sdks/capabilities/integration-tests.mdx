title: Integration Tests
description: Test your SDK against a mock server

<Warning title='Pro Feature'>
  This feature is only available on paid plans. Please schedule a [demo](https://buildwithfern.com/contact)
  or [email us](mailto:support@buildwithfern.com) to get started.
</Warning>

To make sure that your SDK works in production, Fern will auto-generate
integration tests that run before release. The release will only take place
if no tests fail.

### What gets generated?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Mock Server">
    Fern will use your API Definition to generate a mock server that will be used
    in the integration tests. The mock server will assert that the SDK is
    making the correct requests.

    By default, the mock server will use the examples specified in your
    API Definition. If no examples are specified, Fern will generate examples to
    the best of its ability.

    <Note>
    Specifying examples in your API Definition is recommended to ensure so that you can
    control what data is used in the tests.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Integration Tests">
    Fern will generate integration tests as part of your SDK. These integration tests
    will run against the mock server and assert validity of requests and responses.

    The generated tests will use appropriate testing framework for the language:
      - Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript
      - Pytest for Python
      - JUnit for Java
      - RSpec for Ruby
      - NUnit for C#
      - The standard library for Go
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="GitHub Workflows">
    Fern will generate a GitHub workflow that will run the integration tests
    on every pull request, commit and release.

### Adding additional tests

If you would like to add additional tests, you can do so by committing them
directly to the generated SDK repositories. Note that you will need to
add the test files to your `.fernignore` file to prevent them from being
overwritten by Fern.

    <Steps>
      ### Create `tests/custom.test.ts`
      ```typescript
        import { MyClient } from '../src';

        describe('MyClient', () => {
          it('should do something', async () => {
            const client = new MyClient();
            const response = await client.resource.get();
            expect(response).toEqual({ something: 'something' });
          });
        });
      ```

      ### Run your test
      ```bash
      yarn install
      yarn test tests/custom.test.ts
      ```

      ### `.fernignore` your test file
      ```yaml .fernignore {3}
      # Specify any files that shouldn't be modified by Fern

      tests/custom.test.ts
      ```
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
    <Tab title="Python">
      <Steps>
          ### Create `tests/test_custom.py`
          ```python
              from package.client import MyClient

              def test() -> None:
                  client = MyClient()
                  response = client.resource.get()
                  assert response.something === "something"
          ```

          ### Run your test
          ```bash
          poetry install
          poetry run pytest tests/test_custom.py -rP
          ```

          ### `.fernignore` your test file
          ```yaml .fernignore {3}
            # Specify any files that shouldn't be modified by Fern

          tests/test_custom.py
          ```
        </Steps>
  </Tab>
      <Tab title="Java">
      <Steps>
          ### Create `src/test/java/com/example/MyClientTest.java`

          ```java
          package com.example;

          import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
          import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
          import com.example.MyClient;

          public class MyClientTest {

            @Test
            public void testSomething() {
              MyClient client = new MyClient();
              var response = client.getResource().get();
              assertEquals("something", response.getSomething());
            }

          }
          ```

          ### Run your test

          ```bash
          ./gradlew test --tests com.example.MyClientTest
          ```

          ### `.fernignore` your test file

          ```yaml .fernignore {3}
          # Specify any files that shouldn't be modified by Fern

          src/test/java/com/example/MyClientTest.java
          ```
