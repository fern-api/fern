Fern generated SDKs are optimized for great autocompletion in 
code editors. Developers will receive compile errors when they forget to 
specify required fields or attempt to access fields that do not exist.

  TypeScript SDKs are published with type declarations (i.e. `.d.ts` files). This
  ensures that TypeScript consumers can leverage compile-time safety and 
  intellisense when using the SDK. 
  
  Each SDK method is annotated with request and response types.  

  ```typescript maxLines=0 {10}
  import { Genre } from "../genre";

  export interface MovieClient {

    /**
     * Creates a movie
     * @param request the movie to create
     * @returns the created Movie
     */
    void create(request: CreateMovieRequest): Promise<Movie>; 
  }

  export interface CreateMovieRequest {
    name: string;
    genre: Genre; 
  }

  export interface Movie {
    /* Generated ID for the movie */
    id: string;
    name: string;
    genre: Genre; 
  }
  ```
