To publish your Go SDK using [Pkgsite](https://pkg.go.dev/about#adding-a-package):
1. Make sure the repository is set to **public** visibility
2. Make sure you have added a required license (e.g. [MIT](https://opensource.org/license/mit), [Apache](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)) to the repository
3. Send a request to `https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/<github-org>/<github-repo-name>/`

In a few minutes, your SDK should be published to [https://pkg.go.dev/](https://pkg.go.dev/)!
