title: Write docs content using Markdown
description: Use Markdown and MDX to add content to your Fern documentation site, including Fern's built-in component library.
---

## Add Markdown or MDX pages

Add pages manually to your documentation by creating Markdown (`.md`) or MDX (`.mdx`) files. New to Markdown? See [Markdown Guide: Getting started](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/). 

<Note>
NOTE: Throughout our documentation, we refer to both Markdown and MDX as Markdown. [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) is a version of Markdown, extended to allow the use of JSX components.
</Note>

Place your pages inside your `fern/` folder and link to them from your [navigation settings](/learn/docs/building-your-docs/navigation) in the `docs.yml` file.

In the example below, the MDX files are inside a folder named `pages/`.

<CodeBlock title='Example folder structure'>
```bash
fern/
├─ fern.config.json
├─ docs.yml
└─ pages/
  ├─ welcome.mdx
  └─ quickstart.mdx
```
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock title='docs.yml'>
```yml
navigation:
  - section: Overview
    contents: 
      - page: Welcome 
        path: ./pages/welcome.mdx
      - page: Quickstart
        path: ./pages/quickstart.mdx
```
</CodeBlock>

## Page header

Fern automatically generates the `<h1>` page header for each page from `docs.yml`. For example, here's the `docs.yml` entry that maps the page you are reading now:
```yml
          - page: Write Markdown content
            path: ./docs/pages/fern-docs/content/write-markdown.mdx
```
The value for `page` is used as the content of the top `<h1>` element of this page. Thus, when adding content to your Markdown pages, begin with `<h2>` instead of `<h1>`.

## Fern components

Fern has a built-in component library you can use in Markdown. [Explore the components.](/learn/docs/content/components/overview)

## Links in Markdown

### Link target
When clicked, links to relative URLs open in the same tab, whereas links to absolute URLs open in a new browser tab. 

### Link format
Use a `/` character to begin a relative URL to another page on your docs site. This routes to the `url` defined in your `docs.yml` file, such as `example-docs.buildwithfern.com`. For example, if you want to link to `https://example-docs.buildwithfern.com/overview/introduction`, you can write the link in Markdown as follows:

<CodeBlock title='Relative link example'>
```mdx
Read the [Introduction](/learn/overview/introduction).
```
</CodeBlock>

## Images

You can use locally stored images or URLs to include images in your Markdown pages. Use either [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#images-1) or the [`<img>` HTML tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img) to insert the image.

## Embedding local assets

You can embed local assets in your Markdown pages using the `<embed>` tag. This is useful for displaying PDFs, images, videos, and other assets into your docs.

```mdx
<embed src="./path/to/asset.pdf" type="application/pdf" />
<embed src="./path/to/asset.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
<embed src="./path/to/asset.png" type="image/png" />
```

<embed src="../../../../fern/assets/changelogs/docs/embed-fern-waving.mp4" type="video/mp4" width="640px" height="360px" />
<br/>
<br/>
<embed src="../../../../fern/assets/changelogs/docs/embed-fern-species.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="480px" height="679px" />


## LaTeX

Fern supports [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) math equations. To use LaTeX, wrap your inline math equations in `$`. For example, `$(x^2 + y^2 = z^2)$` will render $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$.

For display math equations, wrap the equation in `$$`. For example:

```latex
$$
% \f is defined as #1f(#2) using the macro
\f\relax{x} = \int_{-\infty}^\infty
    \f\hat\xi\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}
    \,d\xi
$$
```

## Diagrams
Fern supports creating diagrams within your Markdown using [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/). Mermaid offers a variety of diagrams, including flowcharts, entity-relationship models, and Gantt charts. To include a Mermaid diagram in your Markdown file, create a codeblock marked with `mermaid`. 

````markdown
```mermaid
erDiagram
    CUSTOMER ||--o{ PLANT-ORDER : places
    PLANT-ORDER ||--|{ PLANT-ID : contains
    CUSTOMER }|..|{ DELIVERY-ADDRESS : uses
```
````

```mermaid
erDiagram
    CUSTOMER ||--o{ PLANT-ORDER : places
    PLANT-ORDER ||--|{ PLANT-ID : contains
    CUSTOMER }|..|{ DELIVERY-ADDRESS : uses
```
