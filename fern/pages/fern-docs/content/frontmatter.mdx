description: Use frontmatter to set a variety of page properties and metadata.

You can optionally use frontmatter to set each page's title, full slug override, meta description, a URL to suggest edits to the page, and its OpenGraph image. You can also use frontmatter to disable certain page element like the table of contents and on-page feedback. 

Frontmatter must be added to the top of a `.md` or `.mdx` file, before the rest of the content. Use sets of three dashes to indicate the beginning and end of your frontmatter, as shown:

<CodeBlock title="Example frontmatter">
```mdx
---
title: Customize content using frontmatter
subtitle: Set titles, add meta descriptions, and more 
slug: frontmatter
description: Use frontmatter to set the page title, subtitle, slug, meta description, its OpenGraph image, and a URL to suggest edits.

```

</CodeBlock>

## Title

**Name**: `title`<br />
**Type**: string<br />
**Default**: The name of the page as specified in `docs.yml`

Set the content for the [`<title>` element](https://web.dev/learn/html/document-structure#document_title) for a page. This title is displayed in browser tabs, history, and bookmarks, as well as in search engine results. Having a unique and informative title for each page benefits your site's SEO (Search Engine Optimization).

<Tip title="Tip">
  For more information, see [Google's guidelines for useful
  titles](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/title-link#page-titles).
</Tip>

If no `title` is provided in the frontmatter of a page, Fern uses the value for that page in `docs.yml`.

For example, if a page is defined like this in `docs.yml`:

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">

```yaml
- page: Overview
  path: ./docs/pages/api-overview.mdx
```

</CodeBlock>

Then, if Fern does not find a `title` in that page's frontmatter, `Overview` is used for the default title.

### Site-wide title text

You can set a field named `title` in `docs.yml` like this:

<CodeBlock title='docs.yml'>

```yaml
instances:
  - url: fern.docs.buildwithfern.com

title: Fern | Documentation # <-- set site-wide
```

</CodeBlock>

The value you enter for this field is appended to every page's title across your docs site, as ` - TITLE_VALUE`.

For example, with the above setting in `docs.yml`, the `Overview` page's title becomes `Overview - Fern | Documentation`.


## Subtitle

**Name**: `subtitle`<br />
**Type**: string<br />
**Default**: None

Renders as a subtitle on the page. If `description` is not set, `subtitle` is also used as the meta description tag.

## Slug

**Name**: `slug`<br />
**Type**: string<br />
**Default**: None

The `slug` you set in a page's frontmatter overrides the URL for that page derived from `docs.yml`. This slug begins from the root of your docs site, ignoring the tab or section that the page is under. This allows you to set a custom full slug for any page.

As an example, consider this navigation setup in `docs.yml`:

<CodeBlock title='docs.yml navigation example'>
```yaml
navigation:
  - tab: overview
    layout:
      - section: Support
        contents:
          - page: Email Us
            path: ./pages/emailus.mdx
            slug: email
```
</CodeBlock>

The `slug` set in `docs.yml` affects only the final part of the URL, so the `emailus.mdx` page is available at `/overview/support/email`.

In contrast, the `slug` that you set in frontmatter affects the full URL. For example, you can set the frontmatter `slug` to `email`, as shown:

<CodeBlock title='frontmatter in emailus.mdx'>
```mdx
---
slug: email
---
```
</CodeBlock>

The page then becomes available at `/email`. 

## Meta description
  
**Name**: `description`<br />
**Type**: string<br />
**Default**: None

Set the [meta description](https://web.dev/learn/html/metadata#description) for a page. Like the page title, the meta description is important for SEO. It impacts the text that search engines display about your page in search results snippets. It can also influence search engine indexing and ranking. For more information, see [Google's guidelines for meta descriptions](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/snippet#meta-descriptions).

## Edit this page

**Name**: `edit-this-page-url`<br />
**Type**: string (absolute URL)<br />
**Default**: None

Provide the absolute link to the source `.md` or `.mdx` file in GitHub. Fern uses it to add an `Edit this page` link to the page, which users of your documentation can use to suggest corrections or additions.

<Frame>
  <img src="./edit-this-page.png" alt="Edit this page feature" />
</Frame>

## Meta image

**Name**: `image`<br />
**Type**: string (absolute URL)<br />
**Default**: None

Configure the `<meta property="og:image">` metadata for a page using an absolute path to an image hosted online. This provides an image to show next to a link to your documentation when the link is shared on social media, using a metadata protocol called [OpenGraph](https://ogp.me/). For more information, see the [web.dev explanation of OpenGraph](https://web.dev/learn/html/metadata#open_graph).

## Table of contents

**Name**: `hide-toc`<br />
**Type**: boolean<br />
**Default**: false

Controls the conditional rendering of the table of contents feature on the right-side of the page. Set to true to disable this feature. 

<Frame>
  <img src="./table-of-contents.png" alt="Table of contents feature" />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  By default, Fern will center the contents of a page when the table of contents is hidden. To control the layout of the page, see the [layout documentation](#layout).
</Tip>

## Navigation links

**Name**: `hide-nav-links`<br />
**Type**: boolean<br />
**Default**: false

Controls the conditional rendering of the navigation links (previous, next) at the bottom of the page. Set to true to disable this feature. 

<Frame>
  <img src="./nav-link.png" alt="Navigation links feature" />
</Frame>

## On-page feedback

**Name**: `hide-feedback`<br />
**Type**: boolean<br />
**Default**: false

Controls the conditional rendering of the on-page feedback form at the bottom of the page. Set to true to disable this feature. 

<Frame>
  <img src="./on-page-feedback.png" alt="On-page feedback feature" />
</Frame>

## Page logo

**Name**: `logo`<br />
**Type**: object<br />
**Default**: None

You can override the site-wide logo for a page by setting a field named `logo` in any page's frontmatter like this:

<CodeBlock title='index.mdx logo example'>

```mdx
---
logo:
  light: https://link-to-image.com/image-light-mode.png
  dark: https://link-to-image.com/image-dark-mode.png
---
```

<Info>
Currently, relative paths are _not_ supported for this field.
</Info>

</CodeBlock>

This field specifies the logo for this page. If no logo is set, the site-wide [logo configuration](/learn/docs/getting-started/global-configuration#logo-configuration) is used.

## Layout

**Name**: `layout`<br />
**Type**: `overview`, `guide`, `reference`, `page`, or `custom`<br />
**Default**: `guide`

Sets the page layout.

- `overview`: A spacious, full-width layout without a table of contents. Perfect for landing pages, section overviews, and content that benefits from maximum horizontal space. Navigation sidebar remains visible.

- `guide`: The default documentation layout featuring a table of contents on the right side. Ideal for tutorials, how-to guides, and any content that benefits from easy navigation through sections.

- `reference`: A full-width layout optimized for an API or SDK reference. Removes the table of contents so you can add another column, such as code examples. Navigation sidebar remains visible.

- `page`: A distraction-free, full-screen layout that hides both the table of contents and navigation sidebar. Best for standalone content that benefits from focused reading experiences.

- `custom`: A blank canvas layout that removes all default styling constraints. Hides both the table of contents and navigation sidebar, allowing complete control over the page layout.
