Accordion Groups allow you to organize content into collapsible sections, making it easier for users to navigate through information. With recent updates, our Accordion component now supports improved search functionality using the browser's built-in search feature.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Basic Usage">
    Accordion Groups can contain multiple Accordion items. Each item has a title and content that can be expanded or collapsed.

    ```jsx
    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Section 1">
        Content for section 1
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Section 2">
        Content for section 2
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Searchable Content">
    The updated Accordion component now uses HTML5 `<details>` and `<summary>` elements, enabling browser search (Cmd+F / Ctrl+F) to find content within collapsed sections.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Accessibility">
    Our Accordion component is built with accessibility in mind, supporting keyboard navigation and screen readers.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Enhanced Search Functionality

The recent update to our Accordion component improves content discoverability by allowing users to search through all content, including collapsed sections, using the browser's search function (Cmd+F / Ctrl+F).
