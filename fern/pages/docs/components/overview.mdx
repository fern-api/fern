Fern provides a library of 15+ built-in-components to make your documentation more interactive and engaging. Components are building blocks that you can add to any MDX page.

## Usage

Specify a component in your MDX file while writing content. For example, to add a `Card` component, use the following syntax:


````mdx
<Card 
    title='Open Source' 
    icon='brands github' 
    href='https://github.com/fern-api/fern'
>
  Give us a star! Fern's CLI & docs source code is available on GitHub. 
</Card>
````

This will automatically render a card with the title, icon, and content you specified.

<Card 
    title='Open Source' 
    icon='brands github' 
    href='https://github.com/fern-api/fern'
>
  Give us a star! The source code to Fern's CLI is available on GitHub. 
</Card>
