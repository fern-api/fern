Fern can integrate with your authentication flow, allowing users to login and have their API key automatically populated with the click of a button.

With this feature, you can **create new users of your API** directly from within your documentation. 

## How it works

To enable this feature, you need to configure authentication so that Fern can securely retrieve API keys for your users. The process works as follows:

1. When a user clicks the "Login" button in the API Explorer, they are redirected to your authentication page.
2. After successful authentication, your system must set a cookie called `fern_token` in the user's browser.
3. This token should be a [JWT](https://jwt.io) encrypted with a secret key that we provide. The JWT should contain the user's API key.

The JWT should have a structure similar to:

<CodeBlocks>
```json Bearer
{
  "fern": {
    "playground": {
      "initial_state": {
        "auth": {
          "bearer_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1c"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```json Basic
{
  "fern": {
    "playground": {
      "initial_state": {
        "auth": {
            "basic": {
              "username": "your_username",
              "password": "your_password"
            }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```json Custom
{
  "fern": {
    "playground": {
      "initial_state": {
        "headers": {
          "API-Version": "2024-02-02"
        },
        "path_parameters": {
          "id": "1234f"
        }, 
        "query_parameters": {
          "sort": "DESCENDING"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</CodeBlocks>

## Setting up auto-populated API keys

- [ ] Reach out to Fern to get your secret key 
- [ ] Send Fern the URL of your authentication page (this is where users will be redirected to after clicking the "Login" button in the API Explorer)
- [ ] Add logic to your service to set the `fern_token` cookie when a user logs in

<Tip>For an example of how to set up the `fern_token` cookie, see our demo implementation [here](https://github.com/fern-api/fern-platform/blob/app/packages/fern-docs/bundle/src/app/%5Bhost%5D/%5Bdomain%5D/api/fern-docs/auth/fern-token-demo/route.ts).</Tip>
