Fern Docs allows you to write Markdown content in your API Reference documentation. This feature is useful for providing additional context, examples, or explanations for your API endpoints. There are a few ways to accomplish this:

## In OpenAPI

If you're using OpenAPI to define your API, you can include Markdown content in your OpenAPI Specification.

For example, you can include a [callout](/learn/docs/content/components/callouts#note-callouts) in the `description` field of an endpoint:

```yaml title="api/openapi.yml"
paths:
  /pets:
    get:
      summary: List all pets
      description: |
        Get a list of all pets in the system.

        <Note>This endpoint requires authentication.</Note>
```

## In Fern Definition

If you're using Fern's simpler API definition format, you can include Markdown content in your API definition.

For example, you can include a [callout](/learn/docs/content/components/callouts#note-callouts) in the `docs` field of an endpoint:

```yaml title="api/service.yml"
service:
  endpoints:
    get:
      path: /pets
      docs: |
        Get a list of all pets in the system.

        <Note>This endpoint requires authentication.</Note>
```

## Adding a summary page

You can also create a Markdown page that provides an overview of your API Reference. This page can include general information about your API, such as authentication requirements, rate limits, or other important details.

To add a summary page, create a Markdown file in your `fern/` folder and link to it in your `docs.yml` file:

```yaml title="docs.yml"
navigation:
  - api: API Reference
    summary: ./pages/api-summary.mdx
```

By including the `summary` field, the `API Reference` section title will link to the `api-summary.mdx` page.

## Adding Markdown content between endpoints

In addition to adding Markdown content to individual endpoints, you can also include Markdown content between endpoints in your API Reference. This content can provide context or explanations that apply to multiple endpoints.

This feature requires you to use the `layout` field in your `docs.yml` file, which is described in the [Customize your API Reference](/learn/docs/api-references/customize-api-reference-layout) guide.

To add Markdown content between endpoints, create a Markdown file in your `fern/` folder and link to it in your `docs.yml` file:

```yaml title="docs.yml"
navigation:
  - api: API Reference
    layout:
      - pet:
          - page: Pet CRUD
            path: ./pages/pet-crud.mdx
          - addPet
          - updatePet
          - deletePet
          - page: Pet Search
            path: ./pages/pet-search.mdx
          - findPets
          - findPetsByStatus
          - findPetsByTags
          - findPetsByType
          - findPetsByBreed
```
