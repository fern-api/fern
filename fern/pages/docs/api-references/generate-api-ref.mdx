title: Generate your API Reference
description: Use Fern Docs to generate your API Reference documentation from your API definition, using your choice of either OpenAPI or Fern Definition.
---

A key benefit of using Fern Docs is that once you've defined your API, you get your API Reference documentation with just one line.
Add `- api: API Reference` to your navigation in `docs.yml` and Fern takes care of the rest! You'll see your endpoints, types,
and cURL snippets automatically populated from your [OpenAPI Specification](/learn/api-definition/openapi/overview) or [Fern Definition](/learn/api-definition/fern/overview).

Example:

```yml docs.yml
navigation:
  - api: API Reference
```

### API Reference configuration options

| Property         | Value                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `api` (required) | Title of the API Reference Section                                                                      |
| `api-name`       | Name of the API we are referencing, if there are [multiple APIs](#include-more-than-one-api-reference)  |
| `audiences`      | List of [audiences](/learn/api-definition/fern/audiences) to filter the API Reference for               |
| `display-errors` | Displays error schemas in the API References                                                            |
| `snippets`       | Enable [generated SDK code snippets](/learn/cli-api/api-reference/snippets/get) in your API Reference            |
| `summary`        | Relative path to the Markdown file; the summary is displayed at the top of the API section              |
| `layout`         | Customize the order that your API endpoints are displayed in the docs site                              |
| `icon`           | Icon to display next to the API section in the navigation                                               |
| `slug`           | Customize the slug for the API section (by default, the slug is generated from the API title)           |
| `skip-slug`      | When `true`, skips the slug generation for the API section                                              |
| `alphabetized`   | When `true`, organizes all sections and endpoints in alphabetical order                               |
| `flattened`      | Display all endpoints at the top level (hides the API Reference Section's title)                        |
| `paginated`      | Display all endpoints on separate pages (by default, endpoints are displayed on one single, long page)  |

### Include more than one API Reference
To include multiple, distinct API definitions in your documentation, you can indicate which to include using the `api-name` property. The `api-name` corresponds to the name of the folder where your API definition is housed. 

```yaml title="docs.yml"
navigation:
  - api: Plant Store
    api-name: plant-api
  - api: Garden
    api-name: garden-api
```
