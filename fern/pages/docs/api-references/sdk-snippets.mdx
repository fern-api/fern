title: Display SDK snippets
description: Enable SDK code examples in TypeScript, Python, Go, and more from the request and response examples documented in your API definition. Once enabled, Fern Docs will automatically populate the snippets within your API Reference.
---

If you use Fern's SDK Generator, you can automatically show SDK code snippets in your API Reference. SDK languages appear in a drop-down. By default, cURL snippets will be displayed to users.

## Configuring SDK Snippets

To configure SDK snippets, you'll need to name your SDKs in `generators.yml` and then reference that name in `docs.yml`. In the following example, We'll use `your-organization` as the package name because it is a common practice. For example, Stripe calls their npm package `stripe` and Twilio calls their PyPI package `twilio`.

### Add examples to your API definition

In order to generate code snippets, Fern needs to read request examples from your API definition. If you're using a Fern Definition, you can follow [these instructions](/learn/api-definition/fern/examples). If you're using an OpenAPI Specification, you can follow [these instructions](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/adding-examples/).

### Define a package name for your SDK(s)

<CodeBlock title="generators.yml">
```yaml
groups:
  production:
    generators:
      - name: fernapi/fern-python-sdk
        version: 2.8.0
        output:
          location: pypi
          token: ${PYPI_TOKEN}
          package-name: your-package-name # <--- add this field
        ...
     - name: fernapi/fern-typescript-sdk
        version: 2.3.1
        output:
          location: npm
          token: ${NPM_TOKEN}
          package-name: your-package-name # <--- add this field
     - name: fernapi/fern-ruby-sdk
        version: 0.6.3
        output:
          location: rubygems
          token: ${RUBYGEMS_TOKEN}
          package-name: your-package-name # <--- add this field
     - name: fernapi/fern-go-sdk
        version: 0.22.0
        github:
          repository: your-organization/your-repository # <--- add this field
        ...        
```
</CodeBlock>

### Add the package name to your docs configuration
Add the package name for the corresponding SDK to your `docs.yml` file. For Go, use the exact URL where the SDK repository is located. 

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml 
navigation:
  - api: API Reference
    snippets:
      python: your-package-name  # <--- needs to match the naming in generators.yml
      typescript: your-package-name
      go: https://github.com/your-organization/your-repository # <--- needs the https://github.com/ prefix
```
</CodeBlock>

### Trigger generation

As the final step, trigger your docs generation by running `fern generate --docs` locally or in CI/CD (i.e., GitHub Actions). The SDK snippets will now appear via a drop-down!

### Set default snippet language

SDK code snippets support several languages. Our development work is driven by customer requests, so please request support for languages not listed here by [opening an issue](https://github.com/fern-api/fern/issues/new/choose).

* csharp
* curl
* dotnet
* go
* java
* javascript
* python
* ruby
* typescript

To set the default snippet language, use the `default-language` key at the top indentation level of `docs.yml`.

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml {1}
default-language: typescript

navigation:
  - api: API Reference
    snippets:
      python: your-package-name 
      typescript: your-package-name
```
</CodeBlock>

## Access via API

If you'd like to bring SDK snippets into your own documentation, you can use the [Snippets API](/learn/api-reference/snippets/get). API access requires a [SDK Business plan](https://buildwithfern.com/pricing) or above.

Merge.dev is an example of a Fern customer that uses the Snippets API to bring Python code samples [into their API Reference](https://docs.merge.dev/hris/employees/#employees_list).

## Endpoint request and response snippets

Looking for information on generating API endpoint request and response snippets? See our documentation on [Endpoint Request Snippets](/learn/docs/content/components/request-snippet) and [Endpoint Response Snippets](/learn/docs/content/components/response-snippet).
