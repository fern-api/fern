If you subscribe to Fern's Pro or Enterprise Plans, you can customize your API Explorer settings to suit your customers needs.

All configuration settings are defined in the `docs.yml` file, under API Reference navigation configuration, in a `Playground` object.
 
### Filtering Server Urls

If you have multiple environments for your API, you can filter the server URLs that are displayed in the API Explorer.

To filter server URLs, add the `environments` property to the `PlaygroundSettings` object in your `docs.yml`, like so:

```yaml
navigation:
  api:
    playground: 
      environments:
        - Staging-A
        - Staging-B
```

### Enabling OAuth 2.0 Authorization Injection

If you have defined an endpoint that executes OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Authorization in your API definition, you can enable OAuth 2.0 Authorization Injection in your API Explorer.
More information on enabling OAuth 2.0 Authorization Injection can be found [here](/learn/api-definition/fern/authentication#oauth-client-credentials).
 
To enable OAuth 2.0 Authorization Injection, simply add the `oauth` feature flag to the `PlaygroundSettings` object in your `docs.yml`, like so:

```yaml
navigation:
  api: 
    playground:
      oauth: true
```
