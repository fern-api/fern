title: Reference packages in your API layout
description: Use `referencedPackages` in your docs layout to modularly include subpackages within custom sections of your API Reference.
---

Fern allows you to reuse and reorganize parts of your API by referencing packages directly in your `docs.yml`. With `referencedPackages`, you can inject one or more API subpackages into any section of your API Reference, enabling complete control over the structure and visibility of your documentation.

## When Should You Use?

Use `referencedPackages` when:
- You want to control where a specific API subpackage appears in your sidebar
- You want to group multiple subpackages under one section
- You want to customize the layout of your documentation while keeping your API modular

## Example

Your API workspace is structured like this:

```bash
apis/
├── public-api/
│   └── definition/
│       ├── _package_.yml
│       ├── api.yml
│       └── ...
```

You can reference this package in your `docs.yml`:

```yaml title="docs.yml"
- section: Public API
  referencedPackages:
    - public-api
```

This will render all endpoints, types, and objects from the `public-api` package inline under the **Public API** section in your API Reference sidebar.

## Configuration

To reference one or more subpackages in your API Reference, add the `referencedPackages` field to a section inside your `docs.yml`.

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
navigation:
  - api: API Reference
    layout:
      - section: Public API
        referencedPackages:
          - public-api  # <--- must match the folder name inside your apis/ directory
```
</CodeBlock>

## Plan Availability

`referencedPackages` is available on all Fern plans that support [custom documentation layouts](/learn/docs/building-your-docs/navigation).

If you’re not sure whether this feature is included in your current plan, [contact Fern support](https://buildwithfern.com/contact).
