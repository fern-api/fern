Fern supports integrating with both [Google Analytics 4](https://developers.google.com/analytics) and [Google Tag Manager](https://tagmanager.google.com/). Follow the steps below to configure these services.

## Google Analytics 4

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have a Google Analytics 4 property ID. This ID is typically in the format `G-XXXXXXXXXX`.

### Integration Steps

1. Open your `docs.yml` file.
2. Add your Google Analytics 4 property ID under the `measurement-id` key.
3. Verify data in Google Analytics. Note that it may take 24–48 hours for website traffic data to start appearing. You can check your browser's developer tools or the network tab to confirm that the analytics script is loading correctly.

Example configuration:

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
analytics:
  ga4:
    measurement-id: G-12345678
```
</CodeBlock>

You can optionally add the ID as an environment variable:

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
analytics:
  ga4:
    measurement-id: ${GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID} # scans for GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID environment variable
```
</CodeBlock>


## Google Tag Manager

### Prerequisites

To use Google Tag Manager, obtain a container ID from your Google Tag Manager account. This ID follows the format `GTM-XXXXXX`.

### Integration Steps

1. Open your `docs.yml` file.
2. Add your Google Tag Manager container ID under the container-id key.
3. Verify data in Google Analytics. Note that it may take 24–48 hours for website traffic data to start appearing. You can check your browser's developer tools or the network tab to confirm that the analytics script is loading correctly.

Example configuration:

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
analytics:
  gtm:
    container-id: GTM-NS32L7KR
```
</CodeBlock>

You can optionally add the ID as an environment variable:

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
analytics:
  gtm:
    container-id: ${GTM_CONTAINER_ID} # scans for GTM_CONTAINER_ID environment variable
```
</CodeBlock>
