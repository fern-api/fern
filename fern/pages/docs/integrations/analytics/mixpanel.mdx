## Add Mixpanel to your Docs

To add Mixpanel to your Docs, you need to create a custom JavaScript file and configure it in your `docs.yml` file using your Mixpanel project token.

### Get your Mixpanel Project Token

1. Log in to your Mixpanel account.
2. Navigate to the project you want to track.
3. Go to **Settings** > **Project Settings**.
4. Copy your **Project Token** from the project details.

### Integration Steps

1. **Create a scripts folder**: Under your `fern` directory, create a `scripts` folder if it doesn't already exist.

2. **Create the Mixpanel script**: In the `scripts` folder, create a file named `mixpanel.js`.

3. **Add the Mixpanel tracking code**: In your `mixpanel.js` file, add the following script (replace `YOUR_PROJECT_TOKEN` with your actual project token):

<CodeBlock title="fern/scripts/mixpanel.js">
```js
// Add the JS snippet to load the script
(function (f, b) {
  if (!b.__SV) {
    var e, g, i, h;
    window.mixpanel = b;
    b._i = [];
    b.init = function (e, f, c) {
      function g(a, d) {
        var b = d.split(".");
        if (b.length === 2) {
          a = a[b[0]];
          d = b[1];
        }
        a[d] = function () {
          a.push([d].concat(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 0)));
        };
      }

      var a = b;
      if (typeof c !== "undefined") {
        a = b[c] = [];
      } else {
        c = "mixpanel";
      }

      a.people = a.people || [];
      a.toString = function (a) {
        var d = "mixpanel";
        if (c !== "mixpanel") d += "." + c;
        if (!a) d += " (stub)";
        return d;
      };
      a.people.toString = function () {
        return a.toString(1) + ".people (stub)";
      };

      i = "disable time_event track track_pageview track_links track_forms register register_once alias unregister identify name_tag set_config reset people.set people.set_once people.unset people.increment people.append people.union people.track_charge people.clear_charges people.delete_user".split(" ");
      for (h = 0; h < i.length; h++) g(a, i[h]);

      b._i.push([e, f, c]);
    };
    b.__SV = 1.2;
    e = f.createElement("script");
    e.type = "text/javascript";
    e.async = true;
    e.src = "https://cdn.mxpnl.com/libs/mixpanel-2-latest.min.js";
    g = f.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];
    g.parentNode.insertBefore(e, g);
  }
})(document, window.mixpanel || []);

// Create an instance of the Mixpanel object
mixpanel.init('YOUR_PROJECT_TOKEN', { autocapture: true });
```
</CodeBlock>

4. **Configure your docs.yml**: In your `docs.yml` file, add the JavaScript file configuration:

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
js:
  - path: ./scripts/mixpanel.js
    strategy: beforeInteractive
```
</CodeBlock>

### Security Considerations

Since Mixpanel tracking is implemented using client-side JavaScript, your project token will be visible in the browser's source code. This is normal and expected behavior for client-side analytics implementations. Mixpanel project tokens are designed to be publicly visible and are safe to expose on the client side.

### Testing Your Integration

1. **Start your development server**: Run `fern docs dev` to build and start your Fern docs locally (typically on `http://localhost:3000`).

2. **Verify script loading**: Open your browser's developer tools and check the Console and Network tabs to confirm the Mixpanel script is loading correctly.

3. **Test event tracking**: Navigate through your docs site and verify that events are being tracked.

4. **Check Mixpanel dashboard**: Go to your Mixpanel project dashboard to verify that events are being received correctly.
