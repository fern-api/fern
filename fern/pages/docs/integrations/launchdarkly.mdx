description: Learn how to use Feature Flags in your Fern documentation
---

Fern supports conditional rendering of documentation content using feature flags, powered by [LaunchDarkly](https://app.launchdarkly.com/signup) integration. Control visibility of documentation sections based on feature flag states for different release stages or user segments.

## Use Cases

Feature flags in documentation are particularly useful for:

- **Regional Content**: Show content based on geography (e.g., EU vs. US endpoints)
- **Product Tiers**: Display features based on subscription levels
- **Beta Features**: Allow specific users to see beta documentation
- **Staged Rollouts**: Gradually release documentation for new features
- **A/B Testing**: Test different documentation approaches with different user segments

## Configuration

Configure feature flags in `docs.yml`:  

```yaml
navigation:
  # Simple boolean flag
  - page: Beta Features
    feature-flag: beta-features

  # Multiple flags (if any flag is true, the content will be shown)
  - page: Advanced Features
    feature:
      - flag: feature-a
      - flag: feature-b

  # Configurable match 
  - section: Enterprise Features
    feature-flag:
      flag: release-stage
      fallback-value: ga
      match: beta
```

To read more about `fallbackValue` and `match`, see the [LaunchDarkly documentation](https://launchdarkly.com/docs/guides/flags/testing-code#fallback-values).

## Using Feature Flags in MDX

Use the `<Feature>` component to conditionally render content:

```mdx
<Feature flag="deployment-region" match="commercial" fallbackValue="commercial">
  <table class="fern-table">
    <tr>
      <th>Service</th>
      <th>Endpoint</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>API Gateway</td>
      <td><code>https://api.example.com</code></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</Feature>
```

### Component Properties

<ParamField path="flag" type="string" required={true}>
  Name of the feature flag to check against
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="match" type="boolean | string" required={true}>
  Value to match against the feature flag's value
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="fallbackValue" type="boolean | string" required={false}>
  Default value if the feature flag is not defined  
</ParamField>

## Example: Complete Configuration

```yaml
# docs.yml
title: API Documentation
navigation:
  - section: Features
    feature-flag: features-enabled
    layout:
      - page: Basic Features
      - page: Advanced Features
        feature-flag: advanced-features
      - page: Beta Features
        feature:
          - flag: beta-access
          - flag: beta-opted-in

  - section: Enterprise
    feature-flag:
      flag: customer-tier
      match: enterprise
      fallbackValue: standard
```

## Real-time Evaluation

Feature flags are client-side only. The information is only visually hidden when the feature flag is evaluated as false.

If you toggle a feature flag on in the LaunchDarkly dashboard, the content will be shown immediately.

Conversely, if you toggle a feature flag off in the LaunchDarkly dashboard, the content will be hidden immediately.

## Server-side Evaluation

Feature flags are client-side only. Want to request server-side evaluation? [Let us know](https://github.com/fern-api/fern/issues) by filing a feature request.
