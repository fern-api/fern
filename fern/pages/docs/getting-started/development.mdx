Fern offers two ways to preview changes to your documentation: a [local development environment](#local-development) and [unique preview links](#generate-a-preview-link).

## Local development

Fern allows you to view changes to your documentation in a locally-hosted environment.

<Info>**Prerequisite**: Please install Node.js (version 18 or higher) before proceeding.</Info>

Follow these steps to install and run the Fern CLI:

**Step 1**: Install the Fern CLI:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g fern-api
```

```bash yarn
yarn global add fern-api
```

</CodeGroup>

**Step 2**: Navigate to the docs directory (where the `fern` folder is located) and execute the following command:

```bash
fern docs dev
```

A local preview of your documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. The functionality is available offline if you have run local development mode online at least once.

<Note>Some features (e.g. search) are disabled in the local development environment.</Note>

### Custom ports

By default, Fern uses port 3000. You can customize the port Fern runs on by using the `--port` flag. For example, to run Fern on port 3002,
use this command:

```bash
fern docs dev --port 3333
```

If you attempt to run Fern on a port that's already in use, it will use the next available port:

## Generate a preview link

Fern allows you to generate a shareable preview link displaying the current state of your docs. Each preview link is appended with a UUID and is not indexed. Currently, these links do not expire (this behavior is subject to change in the future).

**Usage**:

```bash
fern generate --docs --preview
```

**Example**:

```bash
fern generate --docs --preview

[docs]: Found 0 errors and 1 warnings. Run fern check --warnings to print out the warnings.
[docs]: Published docs to https://fern-preview-a1da0157-93ca-4b1f-b310-8dd34fb891ca.docs.buildwithfern.com
