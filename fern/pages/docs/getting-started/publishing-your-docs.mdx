title: Publishing your docs
---

When you are ready for your docs to be publicly accessible, you can publish them using the Fern CLI. 

## Usage

```bash
fern generate --docs
```

### Example

```bash
fern generate --docs
[docs]: Found 0 errors and 1 warnings. Run fern check --warnings to print out the warnings.
[docs]: ✓ All checks passed
[docs]: Published docs to https://plantstore.docs.buildwithfern.com
┌─
│ ✓  https://plantstore.docs.buildwithfern.com
└─
```

### Usage in GitHub Actions

To automate the publishing process, you can use a GitHub Action workflow to publish your docs when a push is made to the `main` branch. [Be sure to add the `FERN_TOKEN` for your organization to the repository](/learn/cli-api/cli-reference/commands#fern-token). 

```yaml .github/workflows/publish-docs.yml
name: Publish Docs

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: ${{ github.event_name == 'push' && contains(github.ref, 'refs/heads/main') && github.run_number > 1 }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install Fern
        run: npm install -g fern-api

      - name: Publish Docs
        env:
          FERN_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FERN_TOKEN }}
        run: fern generate --docs
```

## Unpublishing your docs

If you need to take down your docs site or remove confidential information, you cannot unpublish the site itself. Instead, you should replace the `navigation` object with an empty list. Once published, this will remove all content and lead the user to a `404 error` page.

1. **Update the navigation** in `docs.yml` by changing the file content to:

```yml
instances:
  - <organization>.docs.buildwithfern.com
navigation: []
```

2. **Publish the site** by running `fern generate --docs`.

This approach will:
- Replace your existing docs with an empty site
- Remove any of your information
- Provide a clean slate if you want to rebuild your documentation later

## Hosting 

When you publish your docs, Fern takes care of hosting them for you. To publish your docs to a custom domain, check out our docs [here](/learn/docs/building-your-docs/custom-domain). 

### Self-hosting your docs

<Tip>
This feature is available on the Enterprise plan. [Contact us](https://buildwithfern.com/contact) to learn more.
</Tip>

If you need access to your docs offline or want to host them on your own infrastructure, Fern offers an easy self-hosting option. We provide your documentation site as a ready-to-run Docker container. Simply deploy it to your server or cloud environment to maintain full control over uptime, access, and security.
