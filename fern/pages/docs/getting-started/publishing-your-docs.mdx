title: Publishing your docs
---

When you are ready for your docs to be publicly accessible, you can publish them using the Fern CLI. 

## Usage

```bash
fern generate --docs
```

### Example

```bash
fern generate --docs
[docs]: Found 0 errors and 1 warnings. Run fern check --warnings to print out the warnings.
[docs]: ✓ All checks passed
[docs]: Published docs to https://plantstore.docs.buildwithfern.com
┌─
│ ✓  https://plantstore.docs.buildwithfern.com
└─
```

### Usage in GitHub Actions

To automate the publishing process, you can use a GitHub Action workflow to publish your docs when a push is made to the `main` branch. [Be sure to add the `FERN_TOKEN` for your organization to the repository](/learn/cli-api/cli-reference/commands#fern-token). 

```yaml .github/workflows/publish-docs.yml
name: Publish Docs

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: ${{ github.event_name == 'push' && contains(github.ref, 'refs/heads/main') && github.run_number > 1 }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install Fern
        run: npm install -g fern-api

      - name: Publish Docs
        env:
          FERN_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FERN_TOKEN }}
        run: fern generate --docs
```

## Unpublishing your docs

If you need to take down your docs site or remove confidential information, you cannot unpublish the site itself. Instead, you should publish new content to replace the existing documentation.

### Using the docs starter template

The easiest approach is to use the [docs starter template](https://github.com/fern-api/docs-starter) to replace your existing docs with generic starter content:

1. **Fork or download** the [docs starter template](https://github.com/fern-api/docs-starter)
2. **Update the organization name** in `fern.config.json` to match your existing configuration
3. **Update the URL** in `docs.yml` to match your existing docs site instance
4. **Publish the starter content** by running `fern generate --docs`

This approach will:
- Replace your existing docs with generic starter content
- Remove any confidential or sensitive information
- Keep your docs URL active (avoiding broken links)
- Provide a clean slate if you want to rebuild your documentation later

## Hosting 

When you publish your docs, Fern takes care of hosting them for you. To publish your docs to a custom domain, check out our docs [here](/learn/docs/building-your-docs/custom-domain). 

### Self-hosting your docs

<Tip>
This feature is available on the Enterprise plan. [Contact us](https://buildwithfern.com/contact) to learn more.
</Tip>

If you need access to your docs offline or would like to host your docs on your own server, Fern offers that option as well. Self-hosted docs have limited access to certain features (including search).
