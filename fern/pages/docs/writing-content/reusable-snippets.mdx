Keep your documentation DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) by defining a reusable snippet once, and then referencing it in multiple places. This way, you only need to update the snippet in one place to keep all references in sync.

## Create a reusable snippet

To use reusable snippets, start by creating a new folder in your `fern` project called `snippets`. Inside the `snippets` folder, create a new file for each snippet you want to define.

For example: 
    
```bash
fern
└─ pages
    └─ my-tutorial.mdx
└─ assets
└─ snippets
    ├─ herbs.mdx  
    ├─ peace-lily.mdx    
    └─ trees.mdx
```

In each snippet file, define the content you want to reuse. For example, `peace-lily.mdx` might contain:

```mdx snippets/peace-lily.mdx
<Warning> Remember to water your plant at least twice a week. </Warning>
```

## Use a reusable snippet

To use a snippet in your documentation, reference it by its file path (including the `.mdx` extension) in your content. For example, to include the `peace-lily` snippet in your content, use:


```mdx pages/my-tutorial.mdx
---
title: Getting started with your peace lily
description: Peace lily care tips for beginners
---

## Caring for your new plant

Peace lilies are easy to grow and relatively trouble-free.
