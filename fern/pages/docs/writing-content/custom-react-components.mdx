title: Custom React Components
subtitle: Add your own React components to enhance your docs
---

You can extend Fern's built-in component library by adding your own custom React components. 
This allows you to create unique, interactive elements that match your documentation needs.

<Note>Setting up custom react components is part of the pro plan.</Note>

## How does it work

<Steps>
  ### Create a React component

  Let's start by creating a `components` folder where you can define your react components. Note 
  that the react components can be defined in `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js` or `.mdx` files. 

  ```ts components/CustomCard.tsx 
    export const CustomCard = ({ title, text, link, sparkle = false }) => {
        return (
            <a href={link} className="block p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-200 hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow">
            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">
                {title} {sparkle && "âœ¨"}
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600">{text}</p>
            </a>
        );
    };
  ```

  ### Use the component in your docs

  Once you've written the component, you can start leveraging it in your Markdown guides. 

  ```jsx guide.mdx
<CustomCard 
    title="MyTitle" 
    text="Hello" 
    href="https://github.com/fern-api/fern/tree/main/generators/python"
/>
  ```

  ### Specify your components directory in `docs.yml`

  Add your components directory to `docs.yml` so that the Fern CLI can scan your components directory 
  and upload them to the server. 

  ```yml docs.yml
  experimental:
    mdx-components:
      - ./components
  ```
</Steps>
