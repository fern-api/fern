title: Add an announcement banner to your docs
subtitle: Prominently highlight new features, updates, or important information
---

An announcement banner is a great way to draw attention to new features and product launches. When configured, the announcement bar appears at the top of your docs site. After the user dismisses the bar, it will reappear the next time you update the announcement.

```yaml docs.yml
announcement:
    message: "ðŸš€ New feature: Announcements are available! (<a href=\"https://buildwithfern.com/learn/docs/building-your-docs/announcements\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more</a>) ðŸš€"
```

Markdown and HTML is supported in the announcement message. You can include links, images, and other formatting. [Custom css](/learn/docs/building-your-docs/custom-css-global-js#custom-css) can be used to customize the style of the announcement.
