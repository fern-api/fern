Fern uses [Algolia DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/) to power search for your documentation. 
DocSearch is designed specifically for documentation sites to help users quickly find what they need.

## How search works

DocSearch scans your Fern site, gathers key content, and builds an index to generate search results. 
It includes built-in filters that let users refine their searches by content type:

- **Versions:** For sites with separate documentation for different API versions.
- **Endpoints:**  Filters results to API reference documentation
- **Guides:** Filters results to non-API reference documentation.
- **Changelog:** Filters results to changelog updates.

If you are using the AI Search feature, the search box also functions as your Fern siteâ€™s chat window.

<Note>
    **Note:** If an article includes the `norobots` or `noindex` frontmatter, it will not be indexed by Algolia and will not appear in search results.
</Note>

## Using an alternative search 

You can override Fern's search with your own solution. 
[Here](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-docs/blob/main/fern/assets/component.js) is an example of custom JavaScript a customer used to replace the default search with their own implementation and additional features.
