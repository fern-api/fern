<Note>Configuring RBAC is part of the pro plan.</Note>

Fern allows you to restrict parts of your navigation to individuals with specific roles. Below, we walk through each of the steps
required to configure RBAC.

<Steps>
### Define all the `roles` in your docs.yml

Start by defining all the different roles in your `docs.yml`. You can simply specify thise under a `roles` key:

```yml docs.yml
roles:
  - everyone # every user is given this role
  - partners
  - beta-users
  - admins
```

<Info>The `everyone` role is a special role. Every user has this role.</Info>

### Define viewers on parts of the navigation

Every navigation item (`sections`, `pages`, `api references`) can have a set of designated viewers. If you don't
specify viewers, then it defaults to `everyone` and the page is public.

```yml docs.yml {7-8} {14-16}
navigation:
  - tab: Documentation
    layout:
      - page: Overview
        path: pages/overview.mdx
      - section: Beta Release
        viewers:
          - beta-users
  - tab: API Reference
    layout:
      - page: Overview
        path: pages/overview.mdx
      - section: Beta Release
        viewers:
          - partners
          - admin
```

The viewers are inherited by nested pieces of content. For example, if a section can only be viewed by `admins`, then all its
pages and nested sections can also only be viewed by admins.

### Configure authentication via a `FERN_TOKEN`

In this step, we will configure authentication so that Fern can understand what roles a particular user has. Fern expects the user's
browser session to have a cookie called `FERN_TOKEN`. If the cookie is not present, the user will be redirected to your company's
login page.

Upon login, you must set a JWT for the user using a secret key that we will provide you with. The JWT must have a `fern` claim
with a key called roles.

```json
{
  "fern": {
    "roles": ["partners"]
  }
}
```

<Note>Please reach out to support@buildwithfern.com when you are on this step so we can provide you with a secret key.</Note>
