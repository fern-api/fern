Bring Fern Docs to your custom domain.

You can use:
- A subdomain on your custom domain, such as `docs.example.com`
- A subpath on your custom domain, such as `example.com/docs`

<Tip>This feature is available on the Starter plan and above. [Contact us](https://buildwithfern.com/contact) to get set up.</Tip>

<Accordion title = "Subdomain">

To host your documentation on a subdomain, i.e. `docs.mydomain.com`, you need to create a CNAME record in your DNS settings.

<Steps>

### Update the domain in `docs.yml`

```yaml
instances:
 - url: example.docs.buildwithfern.com
   custom-domain: docs.mydomain.com
```

Merge your changes into `main`. [Here's an example](https://github.com/octoml/fern-config/blob/389b67679953856ba0716537981a6d749635556f/fern/docs.yml#L1-L3 ).


### Create a CNAME record

1. Log in to your domain registrar's dashboard.
2. Navigate to the DNS settings for your domain.
3. Add a new CNAME record with the following details:
   - **Type**: `CNAME`
   - **Name**: `docs` (or any subdomain you want to use)
   - **Value**: `cname.vercel-dns.com.`

### Reach out to us

Once you've completed the steps above, reach out via your dedicated Slack channel or [email](mailto:support@buildwithfern.com).

You may need to create a TXT record to verify your domain. If you do, we'll provide you with the record to add.

### Verify the setup

Once we've completed the setup on our end, you should be able to access your documentation at `docs.mydomain.com`. SSL will be automatically provisioned for your domain, but it may take a few minutes to propagate globally.

<Tip>It's helpful to check that you can acces your new docs site from a mobile device or incognito browser.</Tip>

<Accordion title = "Subpath">

To host your documentation on a subpath, i.e. `mydomain.com/docs`, you need to edit your `docs.yml` configuration and then get provider-specific instructions for setting up the subpath. Common providers include Cloudflare, AWS Route53 and Cloudfront, Netlify, and Vercel.

<Steps>

### Configure the `url` in `docs.yml`

Append that subpath to the end of the `url`. This example use `docs` for the subpath, but you can use any word you like, such as `reference` or `developer`.

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml example for subpath">
```yaml
instances: 
  - url: example.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs
```
</CodeBlock>

### Configure the `custom-domain`

Below the `url`, add a `custom-domain` key as shown in the examples below.

<CodeBlock title="Custom subpath">
```yaml 
instances: 
  - url: example.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs
    custom-domain: example.com/docs
```
</CodeBlock>

[Here's an example.](https://github.com/fern-api/fern/blob/7d8631c6119787a8aaccb4ba49837e73c985db28/fern/docs.yml#L1-L3)

### Update the Fern Docs site

If you created your Fern Docs site using one of our [Docs Quickstarts](/learn/docs/getting-started/quickstart), push the changes you made to your GitHub repository. This runs a GitHub Action to update the site with your new configuration.

If you need to update your Fern Docs site manually, run `fern generate --docs`.

### Create DNS records to point at Fern Docs

This feature is available on the Fern Docs Starter plan and above. Reach out to [sales@buildwithfern.com](mailto:sales@buildwithfern.com) to set up your subscription and obtain DNS records information for your domain registrar.
