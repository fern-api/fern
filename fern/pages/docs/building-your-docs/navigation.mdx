title: Configure your site navigation
description: Set up the navigation for your documentation site built with Fern Docs using the docs.yml file, including tabs, sections, pages, and more.
---

## Use `docs.yml`

Every Fern Docs website has a special configuration file called `docs.yml`. Use this file to configure the navigation for your documentation site. 

### Example Configuration

Here's a complete example of a `docs.yml` file:

<CodeBlock title="An example docs.yml">
```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://schema.buildwithfern.dev/docs-yml.json
navigation:
  - section: Home
    contents:
      - page: Introduction
        path: ./intro.mdx
      - page: Authentication
        path: ./auth.mdx
  - api: API Reference
navbar-links:
  - type: secondary
    text: Contact support
    url: https://example.com/support
  - type: primary
    text: Login
    url: https://example.com/login
```
</CodeBlock>

## Sections, contents, and pages

The navigation organizes your documentation in the left-side nav bar. You can create sections for grouping related content. Each `section` has a name and a list of `contents`. The sections appear in the left-side nav bar in the order that they are listed in `docs.yml`.

In `contents`, list your pages with names and corresponding file paths. The supported file types for pages are `.md` or `.mdx`.

A basic navigation configuration with two sections is shown below. The first section is called `Introduction` and contains a single page called `My Page`. The second section is called **API Reference**. This is a special type of section that's automatically generated by Fern, and you do not need to add any pages to it by hand. For more information, see the [Generate API Reference](/learn/docs/api-references/generate-api-ref) page.

```yaml Example navigation config
navigation:
  - section: Introduction
    contents:
      - page: My Page
        path: ./pages/my-page.mdx
  - api: API Reference
```

If you want to add another page to an existing section, create an `.md` or `.mdx` file. Then in `docs.yml`, create a new `page` in the `contents` list for that section, providing the path to the `.md` or `.mdx` file you created. Example:

```yaml Example navigation config
navigation:
  - section: Introduction
    contents:
      - page: My Page
        path: ./pages/my-page.mdx
      - page: Another Page
        path: ./pages/another-page.mdx
  - api: API Reference
```

To add another section, add another `section` to the `navigation`. Example:

```yaml Example navigation config with additional section
navigation:
  - section: Introduction
    contents:
      - page: My Page
        path: ./pages/my-page.mdx
  - api: API Reference
  - section: Help Center
    contents:
      - page: Contact Us
        path: contact-us.mdx
```

### Hiding content

To hide a page or an entire section of your docs, add `hidden: true`. A hidden page or section will still be discoverable using the exact URL, but it will be excluded from search and will not be indexed.

```yaml Example navigation config with additional section {7, 10}
navigation:
  - section: Introduction
    contents:
      - page: My Page
        path: ./pages/my-page.mdx
      - page: Hidden Page
        hidden: true
        path: ./pages/my-hidden-page.mdx
  - section: Hidden Sections
    hidden: true
    contents:
      - page: Another Hidden Page
        path: ./pages/also-hidden.mdx
```

## Section overviews

To add an overview page to a section, add a `path` property to the section.

```yaml Example section with an overview {7}
navigation:
  - section: Introduction
    contents:
      - page: My Page
        path: ./pages/my-page.mdx
      - section: Guides
        path: ./pages/guide-overview.mdx
        contents:
          - page: Simple Guide
            path: ./pages/guides/simple.mdx
          - page: Complex Guide
            path: ./pages/guides/complex.mdx
```

## Nested sections

If you'd like a section to toggle into more sections and pages, you can nest sections within sections. Here's an example:

```yaml Example navigation config with nested sections
navigation:
  - tab: guides
    layout:
      - section: Learn
        contents:
          - section: Key Concepts
            contents:
              - page: Embeddings
                path: ./docs/pages/embeddings.mdx
              - page: Prompt Engineering
                path: ./docs/pages/prompts.mdx
          - section: Generation
            contents:
              - page: Command Nightly
                path: ./docs/pages/command.mdx
              - page: Likelihood
                path: ./docs/pages/likelihood.mdx
```

## Sidebar icons

For icons to appear next to sections and pages, add the `icon` key. The value should be a valid [Font Awesome icon](https://fontawesome.com/icons) name. Pro and Brand Icons from Font Awesome are supported.

```yaml Example navigation config with icons
navigation:
  - section: Home
    icon: fa-regular fa-home
    contents:
      - page: My Page
        icon: fa-regular fa-file
        path: ./pages/my-page.mdx
  - api: API Reference
    icon: fa-regular fa-puzzle
```

## Links

You can add a link to an external page within your sidebar navigation with the following configuration:

```yaml title="docs.yml"
navigation:
  - section: Home
    contents:
      - page: Introduction
        path: ./intro.mdx
      - link: Our YouTube Channel
        href: https://www.youtube.com/
```

<Frame>
  <img src="./external-link.png" alt="An external link within navigation" />
</Frame>

## Tabs

Within the navigation, you can add `tabs`. Tabs are used to group sections together. The example below shows tabs for `Help Center`, `API Reference`, and an external link to `Github`. Each tab has a `title` and `icon`. [Browse the icons available](https://fontawesome.com/icons) from Font Awesome. Pro and Brand Icons are supported.

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
tabs: 
  api: 
    display-name: API Reference
    icon: puzzle
  help:
    display-name: Help Center
    icon: home
  github:
    display-name: GitHub
    icon: brands github
    href: https://github.com/fern-api/fern
    
 navigation: 
  - tab: api
    layout: 
      - section: Introduction
          contents: 
            - page: My Page
                path: my-page.mdx
        - api: API Reference   
  - tab: help
    layout: 
      - section: Help Center
        contents: 
          - page: Contact Us
              path: contact-us.mdx
  - tab: github
```
</CodeBlock>

Here's an example of what the Tabs implementation looks like:

## Versions

If you have multiple versions of your documentation, you can introduce a dropdown version selector by specifying the `versions`. For more information, check out our [documentation on versioning](/learn/docs/building-your-docs/versioning).
