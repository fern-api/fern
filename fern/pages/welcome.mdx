A beautiful, interactive documentation website

Motivation
----------

Stripe, Twilio, and AWS have the resources to invest in internal tooling for developer experience. They provide SDKs (aka client libraries) in multiple languages and developer documentation that stays up-to-date.

We are building Fern to productize this process and make it accessible to all software companies.
