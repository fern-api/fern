## Motivation

<div className="motivation">
  Stripe, Twilio, and AWS have the resources to invest in internal tooling for developer 
  experience. They provide client libraries in multiple languages and developer documentation
  that stays up-to-date. 

  We are building Fern to productize this process and make it accessible to all
  software companies.
