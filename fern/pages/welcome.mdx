## Motivation

Stripe, Twilio, and AWS have the resources to invest in internal tooling for developer 
experience. They provide SDKs (aka client libraries) in multiple languages and developer documentation
that stays up-to-date. 

We are building Fern to productize this process and make it accessible to all
software companies.
