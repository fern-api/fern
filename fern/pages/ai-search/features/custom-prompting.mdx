subtitle: Learn how to add your own prompts to our AI Search feature.

Out of the box, our AI Search feature uses default prompts to help fine-tune search results. You can reference these in our [system prompts](https://github.com/fern-api/fern-platform/blob/app/packages/fern-docs/search-server/src/utils/system-prompt.ts) file.  

That said, you can customize and add your own prompts to fine-tune results to your liking. 

## Customizing Prompts

<Steps>
  <Step title="Getting Started">
      Run `Fern upgrade` to ensure you have the latest generators installed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure docs.yml">
    Edit the `docs.yml` file to include the `ai-search` tab. Please reference below for an example. 
    ```js AI Search Snippet
    ai-search:
      system-prompt: 
        [Insert your custom prompt here]
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add in your custom prompts">
    Insert your custom prompts in the `system-prompt` field. Anthropic has a [great guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/prompt-engineering/system-prompts) that can help provide ideas and examples for your custom prompts. 
    You can also leverage Fern's [system prompts](https://github.com/fern-api/fern-platform/blob/app/packages/fern-docs/search-server/src/utils/system-prompt.ts) as a starting point.
