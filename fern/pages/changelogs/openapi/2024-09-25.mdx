## 0.1.4
**`(fix):`** The generator now handles `config.filename` being null so that the
configuration for the generator can continue to be backwards compatible.


## 0.1.3
**`(fix):`** The OpenAPI generator now supports adding patterns to any string references.


## 0.1.2
**`(feat):`** The OpenAPI generator now supports a configuration to define the name
of the file that you would like to output.

```yml generators.yml
- name: fernapi/fern-openapi
  version: 0.1.2
  config:
    filename: My-Openapi.yml
```


## 0.1.1
**`(fix):`** The `customOverrides` configuration flag now supports explicit nulls as a way to
delete keys in the generated OpenAPI spec. For example, if you want to
exclude the `openapi.info` block in the generated spec, then you can do something
along the lines:

```yml generators.yml
- name: fernapi/fern-openapi
  version: 0.1.1
  config:
    customOverrides:
      info: null # excludes the info field
```


## 0.1.0
**`(chore):`** The OpenAPI generator now uses version 53 of the IR (previously was on version 23). You
will need to upgrade your Fern CLI to the latest to run this version of the OpenAPI
generator.
