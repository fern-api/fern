## 1.4.5
**`(chore):`** Remove Pydantic field aliases and leverage an internal representation

### What's been fixed
- Pydantic field aliases are removed and replaced with an internal representation. This allows for more robust handling of field aliases and prevents issues with Pydantic V2 and mypy.
Previously, you'd have for V1 and V2 compatibility in Pydantic, you'd want to conditionally apply the config class within the base model, however this would lead to mypy errors when filling out a model with it's field alias. To solve this, We used the deprecated `class Config`, regardless of the Pydantic version to satisfy mypy, which lead to warnings in the console.
Now, we've removed the field aliases and replaced them with an internal representation, which allows us to avoid pydantic config altogether.

If you'd like to disable this feature, you can set `use_pydantic_field_aliases` to `true` in your configuration, which will preserve the existing behavior.
To maintain parity with pre-3.11.0 behavior, update the flag to `true`:

  ```yaml
  - name: fernapi/fern-pydantic-model
    version: 1.4.5
    config:
      use_pydantic_field_aliases: true
  ```
- Pydantic V2 `.dict` calls are updated to be back to pre-3.10.4 logic. This is fix a regression where nested literals were being omitted due to the Pydantic V2 serializers not respecting the recursive .dict logic, as Pydantic V2 shells out `model_dump` calls to Rust library and serializers, as opposed to recursively calling `model_dump`.
It is expected that performance will not be degraded given the Rust-based serializers have optimized performance, compared to the Pydantic V1 .dict approach.
