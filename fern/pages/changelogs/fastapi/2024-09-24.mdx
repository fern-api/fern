## 1.5.0-rc4
**`(fix):`** Use of `IS_PYDANTIC_V2` flag is now only used within universal base models (`pydantic_utilities.py`) and if pydantic version compatibility is not specified
or set to `Both`. Concretely, this means that if your configuration specifies a version for Pydantic, then your generated code will respect that version, and
generate the code for that specific version of Pydantic, as opposed to always generating code compatible with both versions of Pydantic.


### What's been fixed
- `exclude_unset` is now respected when passed in as an option to a model's `.dict` call.


## 1.5.0-rc3
**`(fix):`** Dependencies are sorted within the generated code to ensure that even without running isort the imports are deterministically sorted.

## 1.5.0-rc2
**`(fix):`** The FastAPI server generation now adds model configuration back onto the union utils root model a change that was made when Pydantic V2 support was rolled out, believing
it was not allowed in Pydantic V2.
