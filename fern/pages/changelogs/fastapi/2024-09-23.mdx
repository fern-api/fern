## 1.5.0-rc3
**`(fix):`** Dependencies are sorted within the generated code to ensure that even without running isort the imports are deterministically sorted.

## 1.5.0-rc2
**`(fix):`** The FastAPI server generation now adds model configuration back onto the union utils root model a change that was made when Pydantic V2 support was rolled out, believing
it was not allowed in Pydantic V2.


## 1.5.0-rc1
**`(fix):`** When leveraging the `include_union_utils` configuration flag, the Pydantic models will no longer include transitive dependencies within
`update_forward_ref` calls, since these should not be necessary. This effectively scopes back the changes introduced in 1.5.0-rc0, which included
changes to improve circular reference handling in Pydantic models.
