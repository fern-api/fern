## 1.4.0
**`(fix):`** Auto-completion for unions leveraging union utils now works as expected.

### What's been fixed
- Partial classes created for validation now appropriately ignore the universal root model and only create partials off true extended classes.

### What's changed
- The root type for unions with visitors now has it's parent typed correctly. This allows auto-complete to work once again on the union when it's nested within other pydantic models.
