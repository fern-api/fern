## 0.4.0
**`(feat):`** The generated SDK now includes a rakefile to run any tests prefixed with `test_` in the `test` directory

### What's new
- The generators now create a rakefile to run any tests prefixed with `test_` in the `test` directory. A step is also added to CI to run these test. The dummy test now running also provides a sanity check on the health of the build of the gem, even if no tests are added given the gem is imported.
