## 0.7.0-rc5
**`(feat):`** additional fix for the same issue within 0.7.0-rc4 (regression introduced within the 0.7.0 RCs where the token prefix was dropped from requests).

## 0.7.0-rc4
**`(feat):`** fixes regression introduced within the 0.7.0 RCs where the token prefix was dropped from requests.

## 0.7.0-rc3
**`(fix):`** Module references are now consistent throughout the generated SDK, this was a regression in the previous release.

## 0.7.0-rc2
**`(feat):`** the ruby generator now nests types under a type module to avoid naming conflicts, this is behind a configuration flag

## 0.7.0-rc1
**`(feat):`** Address serialization issues within iterable types

### What's been fixed
- nested loops leverage different variable names to deconflict
- nested loops do not call to_json prior to the subsequent loop

## 0.6.1
**`(internal):`** Release Generator

## 0.6.1-rc0
**`(internal):`** Improve logging within the Ruby generator

## 0.6.0-rc1
**`(fix):`** fix regression where sometimes the parsed_json variable would not be instantiated, and so there'd be a nil ref in the generated code

## 0.6.0-rc0
**`(feat):`** Introduce code snippets and examples for Ruby SDKs

## 0.5.0-rc2
**`(fix):`** Call JSON.parse prior to iterating through an iterable response

## 0.4.0
**`(feat):`** The generated SDK now includes a rakefile to run any tests prefixed with `test_` in the `test` directory

### What's new
- The generators now create a rakefile to run any tests prefixed with `test_` in the `test` directory. A step is also added to CI to run these test. The dummy test now running also provides a sanity check on the health of the build of the gem, even if no tests are added given the gem is imported.
