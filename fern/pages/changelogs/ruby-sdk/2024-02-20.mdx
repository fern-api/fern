## 0.2.0
**`(feat):`** Add support for idempotency headers

### What's changed
- Ruby enum construct now leverages class constants instead of hashes to support better autocomplete
- Discriminated unions are no longer wrapped within a parent object, rather, any field or parameter that depends on a discriminated union now explicitly references the member types in support of better autocomplete.
- Undiscriminated unions are no longer allowed as hashes as input to SDK functions, this is in support of better autocomplete as well.
- The generated Ruby SDKs now support idempotency headers, users may specify idempotency headers within the RequestOptions object
