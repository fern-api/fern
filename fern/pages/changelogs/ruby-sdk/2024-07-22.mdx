## 0.8.1
**`(fix):`** Address serialization issues within iterable types

### What's been fixed
- Nested `hash` types are recursively resolved in `from_json` such that they come back as true hashes, as opposed to structs
- Pass through additional params from request options even if the original request did not have those types of params (ex: query parameters)
