## 0.3.0
**`(fix):`** Generated yardoc now appropriately reflects the typehint of the value type in maps

### What's been fixed
- Ensure the name passed into the 'X-Fern-SDK-Name' header is the name of the gem, not the client class
- If an envvar is specified as a fallback for an auth header, the SDK will now mark that parameter as optional to allow fallback to actually happen
- Generated yardoc now appropriately reflects the typehint of the value type in maps
