## 1.16.5
**`(fix):`** Fix duplicate array types in undiscriminated union properties. Previously, nested unions 
containing different array types (e.g., `array<string, mixed>` and `array<Recipient>`) would 
generate duplicate array annotations in PHP union types (array|array|null). The fix implements 
recursive union flattening with proper deduplication during type generation.
