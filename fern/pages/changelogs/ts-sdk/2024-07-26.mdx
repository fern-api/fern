## 0.36.4
**`(fix):`** Now, import paths are correctly added to stream wrapper tests.

## 0.36.3
**`(fix):`** Support starting the stream on `StreamWrapper.pipe(...)` for shorter syntax when dealing with `node:stream` primitives.

## 0.36.2
**`(fix):`** This release comes with numerous improvements to streaming responses:

1. Introduces new stream wrapper polyfills that implement the ability to stream to more streams, per environment.
2. For `Node 18+`, stream responses can now be piped to `WritableStream`. They can also be streamed to `stream.Writable`, as possible before.
3. For `< Node 18`, stream responses can be piped to `stream.Writeable`, as before.
4. For `Browser` environments, stream responses can be piped to `WritableStream`.
5. For `Cloudflare Workers`, stream responses can be piped to `WritableStream`.


**`(fix):`** Now, there are generated unit tests for the `fetcher/stream-wrappers` core directory which makes sure that Fern's stream wrapping from responses work as expected!
