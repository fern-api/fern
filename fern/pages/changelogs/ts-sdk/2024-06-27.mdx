## 0.26.0-rc2
**`(feat):`** `RequestOptions` now supports overriding global headers like authentication and version.


## 0.26.0-rc1
**`(fix):`** The generator was skipping auto pagination for item arrays that were optional. Now, those are safely handled as well.

## 0.26.0-rc0
**`(feat):`** The TypeScript generator now supports cursor-based auto pagination. With auto pagination, a user can simply iterate over the results automatically:

```ts
for (const user of client.users.list()) {
  consoler.log(user);
}
```

Users can also paginate over data manually

```ts
const page = client.users.list();
for (const user of page.data) {
  consoler.log(user);
}

// Helper methods for manually paginating:
while (page.hasNextPage()) {
  page = page.getNextPage();
  // ...
}
```
