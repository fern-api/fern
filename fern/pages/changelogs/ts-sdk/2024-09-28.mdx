## 0.40.8
**`(fix):`** File array uploads now call `request.appendFile` instead of `request.append` which was causing form data to be in a corrupted state.

## 0.40.7
**`(fix):`** The generated README will now have a section that links to the generated SDK Reference (in `reference.md`).

```md
## Reference

A full reference for this library can be found [here](./reference.md).
```
