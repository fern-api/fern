## 1.9.0
**`(feat):`** Add `formDataSupport` configuration which lets you choose between `Node16` and `Node18`.
The default is `Node16`. If you choose `Node18`, the `form-data`, `formdata-node`, and `form-data-encoder` dependencies will be removed.
`formDataSupport: Node18` supports uploading files from the following types:
* `Buffer`
* `File`
* `Blob`
* `Readable` (includes Readstream)
* `ReadableStream`
* `ArrayBuffer`
* `Uint8Array`


## 1.8.2
**`(fix):`** When a multipart form part is explicitly marked as JSON, serialize the data as JSON regardless of type. 
This also means arrays, maps, etc. will not be split into multiple parts, but serialized to JSON as a single part.


## 1.8.1
**`(fix):`** Fix binary response README.md examples
