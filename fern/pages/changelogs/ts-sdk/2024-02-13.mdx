## 0.11.3
**`(fix):`** ensure SDK generator always uses `node-fetch` in Node.js environments. There is an experimental
fetch packaged with newer versions of Node.js, however it causes unexpected behavior with
file uploads.


## 0.11.2
**`(fix):`** ensure SDK generator does not drop additional parameters from requests that perform file upload. Previously, if an endpoint had `file` inputs without additional `body` parameters, query parameters were erroneously ignored.


## 0.11.1
**`(fix):`** The SDK generator no longer generates a `tsconfig.json` with `noUnusedParameters` enabled. This check was too strict.

## 0.11.0
**`(feat):`** The SDK generator now forwards information about the runtime that it is being
used in. The header `X-Fern-Runtime` will report the runtime (e.g. `browser`, `node`, `deno`)
and the header `X-Fern-Runtime-Version` will report the version.
