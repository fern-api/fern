## 1.3.2
**`(fix):`** Fix dynamic imports in the built dist/esm code.

## 1.3.1
**`(fix):`** MSW is used for generated wire tests, but inadvertently also captures real HTTP request, for example in integration tests.
When the HTTP request does not match any of the configured predicates, it would throw an error, including in the unrelated integration tests.
In this version MSW is configured to bypass instead of throw an error when HTTP requests do not match the configured predicates.
