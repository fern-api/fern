## 1.4.0
**`(feat):`** You can now pass in headers to the root client. These headers will be merged with service and endpoint specific headers.

**`(internal):`** Reduce duplicate code generation by passing headers from the root client down to the subpackage clients.

## 1.3.2
**`(fix):`** Fix dynamic imports in the built dist/esm code.

## 1.3.1
**`(fix):`** MSW is used for generated wire tests, but inadvertently also captures real HTTP request, for example in integration tests.
When the HTTP request does not match any of the configured predicates, it would throw an error, including in the unrelated integration tests.
In this version MSW is configured to bypass instead of throw an error when HTTP requests do not match the configured predicates.
