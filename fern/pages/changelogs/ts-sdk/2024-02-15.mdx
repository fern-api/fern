## 0.11.5
**`(fix):`** Previously `core.Stream` would not work in the Browser. Now the generated Fern SDK
includes a polyfill for `ReadableStream` and uses `TextDecoder` instead of `Buffer`.


**`(feat):`** add in a reference markdown file, this shows a quick outline of the available endpoints,
it's documentation, code snippet, and parameters.

This feature is currently behind a feature flag called `includeApiReference` and can be used

```yaml
config:
  includeApiReference: true
```


## 0.11.4
**`(fix):`** The `Fetcher` now supports sending binary as a request body. This is important
for APIs that intake `application/octet-stream` content types or for folks that have
.fernignored their and added custom utilities that leverage the fetcher.
