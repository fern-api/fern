## 1.6.0
**`(feat):`** You can now specify whether to return streams using the stream wrapper, or return the web standard stream.
Change the type of stream returned by setting `streamType` to `wrapper` or `web` in the `config` of your generator configuration.
The default is `wrapper`.


**`(internal):`** `tests/unit/zurg` are moved to `tests/unit/schemas` to match the name in `src/core/schemas` which is what the tests are verifying.
