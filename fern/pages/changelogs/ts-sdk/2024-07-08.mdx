## 0.27.2
**`(fix):`** The generated readme now moves the sections for `AbortController`, `Runtime Compatibility` and `Custom Fetcher` under the Advanced section in the generated README.

## 0.27.1
**`(feat):`** Support JSR publishing. If you would like your SDK to be published to JSR, there is now a configuration option called `publishToJsr: true`. When enabled, the generator will
generate a `jsr.json` as well as a GitHub workflow to publish to JSR.

```yaml
- name: fernapi/fern-typescript-sdk
  version: 0.27.1
  config:
    publishToJsr: true
```


## 0.27.0
**`(fix):`** Boolean literal headers can now be overridden via `RequestOptions`.

**`(feat):`** The generated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file now supports NPM publishing with alpha/beta dist tags. If the selected version contains the `alpha` or `beta` substring,
the associated dist tag will be added in the `npm publish` command like the following:

```sh
# Version 1.0.0-beta
npm publish --tag beta
```
