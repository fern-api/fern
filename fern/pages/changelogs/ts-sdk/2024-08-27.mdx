## 0.39.7
**`(chore):`** The SDK now produces a `version.ts` file where we export a constant called `SDK_VERSION`.
This constant can be used by different utilities to dynamically import in the version (for example, if someone wants to customize the user agent).


## 0.39.6
**`(fix):`** Browser clients can now import streams, via `readable-streams` polyfill. Additionally adds a
webpack unit test to verify that the core utilities can be compiled.
