## 2.4.8
**`(fix):`** Fix ts readme snippet where const was reassigned. Changed to let.


## 2.4.7
**`(fix):`** Make sure `extraDependencies`, `extraPeerDependencies`, `extraPeerDependenciesMeta`, and `extraDevDependencies` are always merged into _package.json_.
This was previously fixed for `shouldBundle: true`, but not for `shouldBundle: false` (default).
All dependencies should now come through.
