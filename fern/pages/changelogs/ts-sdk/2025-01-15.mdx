## 0.47.1
**`(fix):`** Resolves an issue where nullable query parameters were not null-safe in their method invocations. The
generated code now appropriately guard against `null` values like so:

```typescript
const _queryParams: Record< ... >;
if (value !== undefined) {
    _queryParams["value"] = value?.toString() ?? null;
}
```
