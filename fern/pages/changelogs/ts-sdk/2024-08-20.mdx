## 0.39.5
**`(fix):`** If `noSerdeLayer` is enabled, then the generated TypeScript SDK snippets and wire tests
will not use `Date` objects but instead use strings. Without this fix, the generated
wire tests would result in failures.


## 0.39.4
**`(fix):`** Ensure that environment files don't generate, unless there is a valid environment available.
