## 0.25.0
**`(fix):`** The generator now generates snippets for streaming endpoints. There is also a fix where literals are excluded from inlined requests.

## 0.25.0-rc0
**`(feat):`** The generator now merges the user's original `README.md` file (if any).

## 0.24.4
**`(fix):`** APIs that specify a default environment no longer include an unused environment import in their generated snippets.

## 0.24.2
**`(feat):`** Remove the unnecessary client call from the request/response README.md section.

**`(fix):`** The generated README.md snippets now correctly referenced nested methods. For example,
`client.users.create` (instead of `client.create`) in the following:

```ts
import { AcmeClient } from "acme";

const client = new AcmeClient({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" });
await client.users.create({
  firstName: "john",
  lastName: "doe"
});
```


## 0.24.1
**`(fix):`** Dynamic snippets now support importing the client directly from the package.

```typescript
import { MyClient } from "@org/sdk";

const client = new MyClient({ ... });
```
