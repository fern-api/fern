## 2.1.0
**`(feat):`** Split up Jest configuration into multiple projects.
You can now run the following command to run tests:
* `yarn test`: runs all tests
* `yarn test:unit`: runs unit tests (any non-browser and non-wire tests)
* `yarn test:browser`: runs browser only tests inside of `js-dom`
* `yarn test:wire`: runs wire tests

You can now pass in paths and patterns as an argument to the above commands to filter down to specific tests.
For example: `yarn test tests/unit/fetcher`


## 2.0.0
**`(feat):`** The TypeScript generator has received a large amount of improvements, but to maintain backwards compatibility, they require you to opt in using feature flags.
The 2.0.0 release now has these feature flags enabled by default. Here's an overview of the `config` defaults that have changed in _generators.yml_.

| Option | Before | Now |
|--------|--------|-----|
| `streamType` | `"wrapper"` | `"web"` |
| `fileResponseType` | `"stream"` | `"binary-response"` |
| `formDataSupport` | `"Node16"` | `"Node18"` |
| `fetchSupport` | `"node-fetch"` | `"native"` |

To avoid breaking changes, explicitly set the options above with the `Before` values in the `config` of your generator
in _generators.yml_.

With these defaults, the generated SDKs will have _**ZERO**_ dependencies (excluding devDependencies and `ws` in case of WebSocket generation).
As a result, the SDKs are smaller, faster, more secure, and easier to use.


## 1.10.6
**`(fix):`** Publish multi-platform builds of the TypeScript SDK docker container.
