## 0.14.1-rc5
**`(fix):`** Code snippets are generated for file upload endpoints using `fs.readStream`. Previously, generation for these endpoints was being skipped.

**`(fix):`** If integration tests are not enabled, simple jest tests with a `yarn test` script will be created.

**`(feat):`** In an effort to make the generated code JSR compatible, the generator now
directly imports from files instead of using directory imports.


**`(feat):`** In an effort to make the generated code JSR compatible, we make sure all methods
are strongly typed with return signatures (in this case `_getAuthorizationHeader()`).


**`(fix):`** Generate code snippet for FileDownload endpoint

**`(fix):`** Import for `node-fetch` in `Fetcher.ts` uses a dynamic import instead of `require` which
so that the SDK works in ESM environments (that are using local file output). When the
`outputEsm` config flag is turned on, the dynamic import will be turned into an ESM specific import.


**`(fix):`** The test job in `ci.yml` works even if you have not configured Fern to
generate integration tests.

Without integration tests the test job will run `yarn && yarn test`. With the
integration tests, the test job will delegate to the fern cli `fern yarn test`.


**`(feat):`** Add `allowExtraFields` option to permit extra fields in the serialized request.

```yaml
- name: fernapi/fern-typscript-node-sdk
  version: 0.14.0-rc0
  ...
  config:
    allowExtraFields: true
```
