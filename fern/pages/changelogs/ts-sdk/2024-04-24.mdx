## 0.16.0-rc0
**`(feat):`** The generator now registers snippet templates which can be used for dynamic SDK code snippet generation.

## 0.15.1-rc1
**`(feat):`** Earlier for inlined request exports, we were doing the following:

```ts
export { MyRequest } from "./MyRequest";
```

In an effort to make the generated code JSR compatible, the TS generator
will now append the `type` explicitly for request exports.

```ts
export { type MyRequest } from "./MyRequest";
```
