## 2.0.0
**`(feat):`** The TypeScript generator has received a large amount of improvements, but to maintain backwards compatibility, they require you to opt in using feature flags.
The 2.0.0 release now has these feature flags enabled by default. Here's an overview of the `config` defaults that have changed in _generators.yml_.

| Option | Before | Now |
|--------|--------|-----|
| `streamType` | `"wrapper"` | `"web"` |
| `fileResponseType` | `"stream"` | `"binary-response"` |
| `formDataSupport` | `"Node16"` | `"Node18"` |
| `fetchSupport` | `"node-fetch"` | `"native"` |

To avoid breaking changes, explicitly set the options above with the `Before` values in the `config` of your generator
in _generators.yml_.

With these defaults, the generated SDKs will have _**ZERO**_ dependencies (excluding devDependencies and `ws` in case of WebSocket generation).
As a result, the SDKs are smaller, faster, more secure, and easier to use.


## 1.10.4
**`(fix):`** Add `omitFernHeaders` configuration to omit Fern headers from the generated SDK.


## 1.10.3
**`(fix):`** Remove `qs` dependency.


## 1.10.2
**`(fix):`** Remove `js-base64` dependency in favor of using native implementations.
