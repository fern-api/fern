## 0.39.1
**`(feat):`** The SDK now supports looking directly at a `hasNextPage` property for offset pagination if configured.
Previously the SDK would look if the number of items were empty, but this failed in certain edge cases.


## 0.38.6
**`(feat):`** The SDK generator now sends a `User-Agent` header on each request that is set to
`<package>/<version>`. For example if your package is called `imdb` and is versioned `0.1.0`, then
the user agent header will be `imdb/0.1.0`.


## 0.38.5
**`(fix):`** Addressed fetcher unit test flakiness by using a mock fetcher
