## 0.39.3
**`(fix):`** Multipart form data unit tests only get generated if the SDK has multipart form uploads.

## 0.39.2
**`(fix):`** Allows filenames to be passed from underlying File objects in Node 18+ and browsers
Users can now supply files like so, using a simple multipart upload API as an example:
```typescript
client.file.upload(new File([...blobParts], 'filename.ext'), ...)
```
`filename.ext` will be encoded into the upload.
