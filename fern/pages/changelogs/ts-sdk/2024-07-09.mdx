## 0.29.0
**`(internal):`** Upgrade to IRv48.

**`(feat):`** Add support for pagination endpoints that require request body properties.

**`(feat):`** Add support for pagination with an offset step. This is useful for endpoints that page based on the element index rather than a page index (i.e. the 100th element vs. the 10th page).

This feature shares the same UX as both the `offset` and `cursor` pagination variants.


## 0.29.0-rc0
**`(fix):`** All serializers in the generated SDK are now synchronous. This makes the serializers easier to use and improves the performance as well.

## 0.28.0-rc0
**`(feat):`** Add support for offset pagination, which uses the same pagination API introduced in `0.26.0-rc0`.
