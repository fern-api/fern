## 1.8.0
**`(feat):`** You can now specify whether to return the `BinaryResponse` type for binary response endpoints.
Change the response type by setting `fileResponseType` to `stream` or `binary-response` in the `config` of your generator configuration.
The default is `stream` for backwards compatibility, but we recommend using `binary-response`.

Here's how you users can interact with the `BinaryResponse`:
```ts
const response = await client.getFile(...);
const stream = response.stream();
// const arrayBuffer = await response.arrayBuffer();
// const blob = await response.blob();
// const bytes = await response.bytes();
const bodyUsed = response.bodyUsed;
```
The user can choose how to consume the binary data.


## 1.7.2
**`(fix):`** Fix bug where duplicate file generation was silently allowed instead of failing. The `withSourceFile` method now properly 
handles the `overwrite` option to prevent unintended file overwrites.
