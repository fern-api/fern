## 0.51.3
**`(fix):`** Fix minor type issue for polyfilling Headers in Node 16 and below.

## 0.51.2
**`(fix):`** When uploading files, extract the filename from the `path` property if present on the given object.
This will extract the filename for `fs.createReadStream()` for example.


## 0.51.1
**`(fix):`** Fallback to a custom `Headers` class implementation if the native `Headers` class is not available.
Versions of Node 16 and below do not support the native `Headers` class, so this fallback is necessary to ensure compatibility.
