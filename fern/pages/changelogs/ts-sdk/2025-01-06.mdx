## 0.46.0
**`(feat):`** SDKs are now built and exported in both CommonJS (legacy) and ESModule format.

**`(feat):`** Export `serialization` code from root package export.
```ts
import { serialization } from `@packageName`;
```

The serialization code is also exported as `@packageName/serialization`.
```ts
import * as serialization from `@packageName/serialization`;
```


**`(feat):`** `package.json` itself is exported in `package.json` to allow consumers to easily read metadata about the package they are consuming.
