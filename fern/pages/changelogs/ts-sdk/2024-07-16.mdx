## 0.36.1
**`(fix):`** Now, there are generated unit tests for the `auth` and `fetcher` core directory which makes sure that Fern's fetcher and authorization helpers work as expected!

## 0.36.0
**`(fix):`** Now, there are generated unit tests for the `schemas` core directory which makes sure that Fern's request + response validation will work as expected!

## 0.35.0
**`(fix):`** Support Multipart Form uploads where `fs.createReadStream` is passed. This requires coercing the stream into a `File`.

## 0.34.0
**`(internal):`** Upgrade to IRv50.

**`(feat):`** Add support for generating an API version scheme in `version.ts`.
Consider the following `api.yml` configuration:

```yaml
version:
  header: X-API-Version
  default: "1.0.0"
  values:
    - "1.0.0-alpha"
    - "1.0.0-beta"
    - "1.0.0"
```

The following `version.ts` file is generated:

```typescript
/**
* This file was auto-generated by Fern from our API Definition.
*/

/** The version of the API, sent as the X-API-Version header. */
export type AcmeVersion = "1.0.0" | "2.0.0" | "latest";
```

If a default value is specified, it is set on every request but can be overridden
in either the client-level `Options` or call-specific `RequestOptions`. If a default
value is _not_ specified, the value of the header is required on the generated `Options`.

An example call is shown below:

```typescript
import { AcmeClient } from "acme";

const client = new AcmeClient({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", xApiVersion: "2.0.0" });
await client.users.create({
  firstName: "john",
  lastName: "doe"
});
```


## 0.33.0
**`(fix):`** This release comes with numerous improvements to multipart uploads:

1. `Fetcher.ts` no longer depends on form-data and formdata-node which reduces
  the size of the SDK for all consumers that are not leveraging multipart form
  data uploads.
2. The SDK now accepts `fs.ReadStream`, `Blob` and `File` as inputs and handles
  parsing them appropriately.
3. By accepting a `Blob` as a file parameter, the SDK now supports sending the
  filename when making a request.
