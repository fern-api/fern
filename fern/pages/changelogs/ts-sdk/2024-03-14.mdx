## 0.12.7
**`(feat):`** the SDK will now leverage environment variable defaults, where specified, for authentication variables, such as bearer tokens, api keys, custom headers, etc.

Previously, the SDK would only leverage these defaults for bearer token auth IF auth was mandatory throughout the SDK.
