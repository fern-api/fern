## 0.20.7
**`(fix):`** Simplify the error handling introduced in `0.20.6` so that it more easily handles endpoints that include structured errors.

## 0.20.6
**`(fix):`** This updates the behavior of the failure condition introduced in `0.20.2`; the SDK
now throws an error whenever we fail to refresh an access token even if `neverThrowErrors`
is set. We treat this failure as a systematic exception, so it's OK to throw in this case.
