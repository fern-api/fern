## 0.7.1
**`(internal):`** Bump intermediate representation to v31

**`(fix):`** The generated models now support boolean literals and users
do not have to specify them in the builder.
For example, for the following object
```yaml
Actor:
  properties:
    name: string
    isMale: literal<true>
```
the user will not need to specify the literal properties when building
the object.
```java
var actor = Actor.builder()
  .name("Brad Pitt")
  .build();
```
