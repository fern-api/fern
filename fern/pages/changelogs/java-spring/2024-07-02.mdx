## 0.9.1-rc0
**`(internal):`** The Spring generator now adds a class-level `@JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_ABSENT)` annotation to
each generated type in place of the previous `@JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_EMPTY)` by default. This ensures
that required empty collection fields are not removed from request or response json. This is configurable in the
`generators.yml` file:
```yaml
generators:
  - name: fernapi/fern-java-spring
    config:
      json-include: non-empty # default non-absent
```
