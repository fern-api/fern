## 0.18.0-rc0
**`(fix):`** Remove extraneous `next` in the generated service.


## 0.17.7
**`(internal):`** Upgrade to IRv55.

## 0.17.6
**`(feat):`** Re-release the `0.17.5` version.

## 0.17.5
**`(feat):`** Introduces a configuration `noOptionalProperties` which forces consumers to explicitly pass 
in `undefined` instead of excluding the key. To turn this setting on, do the following: 

```yml generators.yml
groups: 
  server: 
    generators: 
      - name: fernapi/fern-typescript-express
        version: 0.17.5
        config: 
          noOptionalProperties: true
```


## 0.17.4
**`(fix):`** Update inlined request objects to respect `noSerdeLayer`

## 0.17.3
**`(internal):`** Upgrade to IRv53.

## 0.17.2
**`(internal):`** Upgrade to IRv50.

## 0.17.1
**`(fix):`** This fixes a bug introduced in `0.17.0-rc0` that prevented the SDK from serializing types with circular references.

## 0.17.0
**`(internal):`** Upgrade to IRv48.

## 0.17.0-rc0
**`(fix):`** All serializers in the generated express server are now synchronous. This makes the serializers easier to use and improves the performance as well.

## 0.16.3
**`(feat):`** The Express generator now supports a `requestValidationStatusCode` configuration
where a user can specify the status code that should be thrown when the request doesn't
match schema validation.

```yaml
- name: fernapi/fern-typescript-express
  version: 0.16.3
  config:
    requestValidationStatusCode: 400 # Defaults to 422
```


## 0.16.2
**`(fix):`** The generator is now upgraded to `v46.2.0` of the IR.

## 0.16.1
**`(fix):`** Undiscriminated unions used as map keys examples no longer return an error.

## 0.16.0
**`(feat):`** The generator now supports `bigint` types.

**`(internal):`** Bump to IRv46.

## 0.15.0
**`(feat):`** Every endpoint method now accepts a third parameter called `next`. This gives
express authors access to the express internals if they are useful

```ts
getUsers: (req, res, next: NextFunction) => {
  // implementation
};
```


## 0.14.0
**`(feat):`** Support a `skipResponseValidation` configuration so that users can disable
response validation. Note that this will still keep the serialization layer. To enable
this configuration, add the following option to your `generators.yml`:

```yaml
config:
  skipResponseValidation: true
```


## 0.13.0
**`(feat):`** Bump to v43 of IR which means that you will need `0.26.1` of the Fern CLI version. To bump your
CLI version, please run `fern upgrade`.

If you specify custom response status codes, the underlying express implementation will send that back
to the user.


## 0.12.0
**`(fix):`** Remove unnecessary `console.error` statements whenever the server implementation throws an error.

**`(feat):`** Support a `skipRequestValidation` configuration so that users can disable
request validation if they want to. To do so, add the following option to your
`generators.yml`

```yaml
config:
  skipRequestValidation: true
```


**`(internal):`** Support V38 of the IR

## 0.11.0-rc0
**`(feat):`** Add `allowExtraFields` option to permit extra fields in the returned response.

```yaml
- name: fernapi/fern-typscript-express
  version: 0.11.0-rc0
  ...
  config:
    allowExtraFields: true
```


## 0.10.0
**`(internal):`** Support V37 of the IR.

## 0.10.0-rc0
**`(feat):`** Add `retainOriginalCasing` option to preserve the naming convention expressed in the API.
For example, the following Fern definition will generate a type like so:

```yaml
types:
  GetUsersRequest
    properties:
      group_id: string
```


## 0.9.9
**`(fix):`** Compile started failing for express generators with the following error:

```
error TS2688: Cannot find type definition file for 'mime'.

The file is in the program because:
  Entry point for implicit type library 'mime'
```

The root cause is because a breaking change was released in v4 of the mime library.
This is now fixed because the generator resolves to v3 of the library as
specified in this GitHub [issue](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-admin-node/issues/2512).


## 0.9.8
**`(feat):`** Enhance serde performance by reducing reliance on async behavior and lazy async dynamic imports

**`(internal):`** Shared generator notification and config parsing logic.

## 0.9.7
**`(internal):`** Release 0.9.7
