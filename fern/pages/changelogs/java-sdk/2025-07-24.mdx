## 2.39.0
**`(feat):`** Enable builder extensibility for generated SDK clients. Builders are no longer marked as final, allowing users to extend them 
and customize client behavior. Added protected buildClientOptions() method for customization hooks and static from() method 
to ClientOptions.Builder for copying existing configurations. This enables use cases like environment variable expansion 
in URLs and custom authentication methods.
