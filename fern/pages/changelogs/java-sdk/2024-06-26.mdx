## 1.0.1
**`(break):`** The Java SDK is now on major version 1. To take this upgrade without any breaks, please add the below
configuration to your `generators.yml` file:
```yaml
generators:
  - name: fernapi/fern-java-sdk
    config:
      base-api-exception-class-name: ApiError
      base-exception-class-name: CompanyException # Optional: This should only be set if default naming is undesirable
```


**`(feat):`** We now generate Exception types for all errors that are defined in the IR. Generated clients with an
error discrimination strategy of "status code" will throw one of these typed Exceptions based on the status code of
error responses. Example error type:
```java
public final class BadRequest extends MyCompanyApiError {
  public BadRequest(Object body) {
      super("BadRequest", 400, body);
  }
}
```
