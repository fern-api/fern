## 0.9.5
**`(fix):`** Types without fields are now generated with builders. Previously, they were not, which made them impossible to initialize.

## 0.9.4
**`(fix):`** The SDK now generates undiscriminated unions with de-conflicted method signatures. Previously, certain undiscriminated unions would have failed to compile due to Java's type erasure causing conflicts.
