## 0.8.6
**`(fix):`** The SDK now generates RequestOptions functions for timeouts with IdempotentRequestOptions correctly, previously
timeout functions were only taking in regular RequestOptions. This also addresses a JavaPoet issue where fields were
being initialized twice across RequestOptions and IdempotentRequestOptions classes, preventing the SDK from generating at all.
