## 1.0.2-rc0
**`(feat):`** The generator now adds a class-level `@JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_ABSENT)` annotation to
each generated type in place of the previous `@JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_EMPTY)` by default. This is
configurable in the `generators.yml` file:
```yaml
generators:
  - name: fernapi/fern-java-sdk
    config:
      json-include: non-empty # default non-absent
```
