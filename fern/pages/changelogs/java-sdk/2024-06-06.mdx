## 0.9.8
**`(feat):`** `RequestOptions` are now generated with the `timeout` field initialized to `Optional.empty()` instead of `null` to avoid NPEs if `timeout` is not set in the builder.


## 0.9.7
**`(feat):`** The SDK generator now generates `@java.lang.Override` over `@Override` in all files to avoid clashes with any
`Override.java` class that may have been generated in the same package. The former was used most places, but not all,
until this release.
