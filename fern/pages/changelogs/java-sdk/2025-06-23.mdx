## 2.38.1
**`(fix):`** Fix JavaDoc generation to properly escape dollar signs ($) when using JavaPoet.

When generating JavaDoc comments with JavaPoet, dollar signs need to be escaped as `$$` to prevent 
JavaPoet from interpreting them as template variables. This ensures that dollar signs in documentation 
are rendered correctly in the final generated code.


## 2.38.0
**`(chore):`** Add support for custom config publish-to to enable publishing to Maven Central with proper metadata and signing configuration.

```yaml
customConfig:
  publish-to: central
```

This configuration enables automatic publishing to Maven Central with proper metadata and signing configuration.


## 2.37.2
**`(chore):`** No changes. Publishing changes from 2.37.1-rc0 and 2.37.1-rc1 to release track.
