## 0.42.11
**`(fix):`** The API V2 configuration now supports disabling using titles as schema
names. You may want to disable this flag if your OpenAPI adds the same
title to multiple schemas.

```
api:
  specs:
    - openapi: /path/to/openapi
      settings:
        use-title-as-schema-name: false
```


## 0.42.10
**`(fix):`** Previously, the OpenAPI converter would bring over `title` on every
single property. This field is extraneous, so now we ignore it.


## 0.42.9
**`(fix):`** Previously, the OpenAPI importer would ignore skip parsing arbitrary
content types "*/*". Now it treats this content type as application/json.

```json openapi.json
"responses": {
  "200": {
    "description": "Success reply",
    "content": {
      "*/*": {
```
