## 0.41.1
**`(feat):`** Adds a V2 configuration for the `api` block that is more flexible and allows
OpenAPI users to consume Fern Definition features.

For example, now you can override environments directly in the api configuration:
```yml
api:
  environments:
    Production: https://prod.com
    Staging: https://staging.com
  specs:
    - openapi: path/to/openapi
      overrides: path/to/overrides
```

If you want to define, multi-url environments, those can be done by configuring the following generators.yml:
```yml
api:
  environments:
    Production:
      urls:
        api: https://api.com
        auth: https://auth.com
    Staging:
        api: https://stagingapi.com
        auth: https://stagingauth.com
  specs:
    - openapi: path/to/openapi
      overrides: path/to/overrides
```

Note that you will need to use the `x-fern-server-name` annotation on each endpoint to assign it to a relevant server. For example,

```yml
paths:
  /api/users/:
    get:
      x-fern-server-name: api
  /token:
    post:
      x-fern-server-name: auth
```


## 0.41.0
**`(feat):`** Adds generic object declarations to the fern definition. Now we can define generics and
use them in alias declarations to minimize code duplication:

```yml
types:
  GenericTest<T>:
    properties:
      value: T
      other-value: string

  GenericApplication:
    type: GenericTest<string>
```
