## 0.57.20
**`(fix):`** Correctly parse primitive type arrays in the v3 OpenAPI parser.


## 0.57.19
**`(fix):`** Fix an issue in the OpenAPI parser where array references were not being properly resolved. The parser now correctly resolves references 
within array schemas, ensuring that arrays of referenced types are properly handled throughout the API definition.


## 0.57.18
**`(fix):`** Improve the ReadMe migrator to respect the original navigation structure when creating the file hierarchy. Previously, nested navigation groups were 
flattened, but now the file structure will mirror the navigation hierarchy, preserving the original organization of documentation.
