## 0.58.0
**`(feat):`** Add support for the `x-fern-sdk-namespace` extension, which allows users to define schemas
with the same name across different namespaces. This is particularly relevant if you have
multiple API Definitions that have overlapping schema names or operation names.


**`(fix):`** Fix an issue where custom Content-Type headers were not respected for file upload endpoints.


## 0.57.37
**`(feat):`** Improve OpenRPC request example generation by not wrapping request payloads in JSON-RPC 2.0 format. 
This ensures generated request examples match the expected format for the API's method parameters 
without the additional JSON-RPC envelope.
