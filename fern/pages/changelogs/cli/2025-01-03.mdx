## 0.46.19
**`(fix):`** If a schema in OpenAPI or AsyncAPI has `additionalProperties: true` then the Fern CLI will now respect bringing in
example properties that are not defined in the schema. Previously, the CLI would skip them.


## 0.46.18
**`(fix):`** If an object or request is annotated with `extra-properties: true` then the user can provide an example that includes
extra properties that are no longer in the schema.

For example, check out this fern definition

```yml service.yml
types:
  Item:
    extra-properties: true
    properties:
      id: string


service:
  auth: false
  base-path: ""
  endpoints:
    create:
      method: POST
      path: /item
      request:
        name: CreateItemRequest
        body:
          extra-properties: true
          properties:
            id: string
      response:
        type: Item
      examples:
        - name: "Item"
          request:
            id: "123"
            foo: "bar" # extra property in the example
          response:
            body:
              id: "123"
              foo: "bar" # extra property in the example
```
