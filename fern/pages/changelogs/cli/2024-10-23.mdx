## 0.45.0-rc17
**`(fix):`** - Improved union example generation by increasing depth for better handling of recursive structures.
- Updated Conjure importer to represent binary types as bytes for requests and file for responses in Fern.
- Added detailed error messages when 'fern docs dev' fails, accessible with --log-level debug.


## 0.45.0-rc16
**`(fix):`** The Conjure importer now correctly keys the union subvariant by the property of the discriminant.

```conjure
union:
  discriminant: type
  union:
    square: Square
    circle: Circle
```

is equal to the following Fern Definition:

```yml fern
union:
  discriminant: type
  types:
    square:
      type: Square
      key: square
    circle:
      type: Circle
      key: circle
```
