## 0.57.24
**`(fix):`** Fix an issue in the OpenAPI importer where discriminated unions with literal discriminant values in the variants would render the discriminant property twice. 
The importer now correctly checks if union variants contain the discriminant property as a literal value and handles them appropriately.
