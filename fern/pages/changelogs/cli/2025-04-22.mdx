## 0.57.35
**`(feat):`** Improve OpenAPI response handling for 204 status codes by respecting schema definitions. 
When a 204 (No Content) response includes a schema, the importer now properly processes 
and preserves this schema information, ensuring accurate API documentation and SDK generation 
even for endpoints that don't return content in successful responses.
