## 0.59.6
**`(fix):`** Add support for local SDK generation with a Fern token. When a valid Fern token is provided, 
users can now generate complete SDKs locally using Docker, without requiring remote generation. 
This enhancement improves the development workflow by allowing for faster iteration and testing 
of SDK changes in local environments.
