## 0.60.3
**`(feat):`** Query parameter and path parameter generation in the new OpenAPI parser now respects the skipOptionalProperties flag. This ensures that optional
parameters are properly handled during example generation, resulting in cleaner and more accurate examples that better reflect real-world API usage.


## 0.60.2
**`(fix):`** Fix a bug where the v3 parser would throw an error upon receiving an object property schema that is not an object.


## 0.60.1
**`(fix):`** Fix an issue where example generation would not correctly merge allOf schemas with parent object schemas.


## 0.60.0
**`(feat):`** Promotes `fern docs dev --beta` to `fern docs dev`; local development now better reflects the production version of docs. To use the legacy version, use the `--legacy` flag.


## 0.59.6
**`(fix):`** Add support for local SDK generation with a Fern token. When a valid Fern token is provided, 
users can now generate complete SDKs locally using Docker, without requiring remote generation. 
This enhancement improves the development workflow by allowing for faster iteration and testing 
of SDK changes in local environments.
