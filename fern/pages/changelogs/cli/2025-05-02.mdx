## 0.60.4
**`(feat):`** Add support for custom parameters in OpenRPC through the `x-fern-parameters` extension. This extension allows OpenRPC 
definitions to specify path parameters, query parameters, and headers that aren't natively supported in the OpenRPC 
specification. Parameters defined with this extension are properly converted to the Fern IR format and included in 
endpoint definitions, enabling more complete API representations when importing from OpenRPC sources.
