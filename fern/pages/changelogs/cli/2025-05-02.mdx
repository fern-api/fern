## 0.60.7
**`(feat):`** Add support for auth descriptions in generated documentation. Auth schemes can now include descriptive text that explains authentication requirements, 
which is properly displayed in the generated documentation. This enhancement improves API usability by providing clearer guidance on authentication 
methods directly within the documentation.


## 0.60.6
**`(feat):`** Enable v2 example injection for multipart form upload endpoints.


## 0.60.5
**`(feat):`** Several improvements to AsyncAPI package and channel generation. Add support for 2.x specific extensions.


## 0.60.4
**`(feat):`** Add support for custom parameters in OpenRPC through the `x-fern-parameters` extension. This extension allows OpenRPC 
definitions to specify path parameters, query parameters, and headers that aren't natively supported in the OpenRPC 
specification. Parameters defined with this extension are properly converted to the Fern IR format and included in 
endpoint definitions, enabling more complete API representations when importing from OpenRPC sources.
