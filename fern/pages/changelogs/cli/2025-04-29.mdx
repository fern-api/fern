## 0.59.0
**`(feat):`** Add the `fern sdk version` command to generate the next semantic version based on your API changes.
This command is in-development; changes are expected.

## 0.58.6
**`(feat):`** Add support for schema conversion in OpenRPC importer. The importer now properly converts schemas defined in the 
OpenRPC document's components section into Fern types, enabling full type definitions for request and response 
objects. This enhancement allows for more complete and accurate SDK generation from OpenRPC specifications.
