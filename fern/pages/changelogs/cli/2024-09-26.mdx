## 0.43.5
**`(fix):`** If you use the `x-fern-streaming` extension and want to provide different descriptions
for the streaming endpoint, then you can now specify `streaming-description`.

```yml openapi.yml
x-fern-streaming:
  stream-condition: $request.stream
  stream-description: The streaming version of this endpoint returns a series of chunks ...
  response:
    $ref: #/components/schemas/Response
  stream-response:
    $ref: #/components/schemas/ResponseChunk
```


## 0.43.4
**`(fix):`** The OpenAPI parser now respects the content type in your OpenAPI spec, instead of always sending
`application/json`. With this upgrade, your SDKs will also start to send the correct content type.


## 0.43.3
**`(chore):`** The CLI now passes in the API definition ID once again, this is necessary so that generated snippet templates
may reference schemas within the API. This was a regression that was recently introduced.


## 0.43.2
**`(fix):`** The CLI now prints which API cannot be registered if `fern generate --docs` fails.
