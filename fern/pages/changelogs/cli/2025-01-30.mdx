## 0.51.13
**`(fix):`** OpenAPI overrides now support resolving file references from the location of the
OpenAPI overrides file itself. Previously, relative paths were only resolved from
the OpenAPI source file.

Most users will experience no change, but this will enable a wider set of file
directory layouts depending on the user's preference.


## 0.51.12
**`(fix):`** The Fern Definition now allows you to declare status codes for the response without having a type.
This is useful for `204` response status codes.

```yml users.yml
service:
  auth: false
  base-path: /users
  endpoints:
    update:
      path: ""
      response:
        status-code: 204
```
