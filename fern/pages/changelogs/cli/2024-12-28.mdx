## 0.46.16
**`(fix):`** Improve parsing of OpenAPI schemas with an array in the `type` property.
* If the array contains `"null"`, it is interpreted as nullable, and removed from the array.
* If there is only a single item in the array (after removing "null"), it previously defaulted to `unknown`, but now the specified type is used.
