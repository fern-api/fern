## 0.41.0-rc0
**`(break):`** Every fern folder that is using OpenAPI must configure an explicit location to the
OpenAPI spec. The location can be configured in your `generators.yml`:

```yml
api:
  path: path/to/openapi.yml
```

If you run **fern upgrade**, the CLI will automatically run a migration for you to
ensure that you are compliant!


## 0.40.4
**`(fix):`** `fern check` allows the service base-path to be a slash. For example, the following
would be valid:

```yml
service:
  base-path: "/"
```


## 0.40.3
**`(fix):`** Now `fern generator upgrade` respects  the `--group` flag and only upgrades generators within a particular group.
