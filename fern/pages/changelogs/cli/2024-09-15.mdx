## 0.41.14-rc2
**`(internal):`** Remove bang operator and fix eslint warning in `compatible-ir-versions.ts`.

## 0.41.14-rc1
**`(feat):`** Running `fern check` will now check to confirm that the generator versions you are running are compatible with your Fern CLI version.

Each version of SDK generators depends on a version of a library that is exported by the Fern CLI, and as a result, each generator has a minimum
compatible version of the Fern CLI. As an example, if you were to run `fern check` while leveraging `fernapi/fern-python-sdk` version `2.0.0`, on CLI version `0.1.3`, you'd receive the following error:

`The generator fernapi/fern-python-sdk requires CLI version 0.23.0-rc4 or later (current version: 0.1.3-rc0).`

Indicating that you must upgrade your CLI in order to leverage the current generator.


### What's new
- Running `fern check` will now check to confirm that the generator versions you are running are compatible with your Fern CLI version.
- Fern commands now print out generator upgrades, in addition to CLI upgrades.
