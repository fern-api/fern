## 0.50.16
**`(fix):`** This PR improves the performance of `fern docs dev`:
  - Fern does not generate examples if the user has provided them to us
  - Temporarily comment out broken link checker until we make it faster


## 0.50.15
**`(fix):`** Move example generation failure logs to trace level since they are not relevant
for users and add noise to debug logs.


## 0.50.14
**`(fix):`** Fixes a bug where duplicate types in undiscriminated unions (`oneOf` in OpenAPI)
were not being deduped, which could lead to invalid generated code.
