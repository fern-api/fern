## 0.41.14-rc0
**`(fix):`** The Fern CLI now safely handles a npx file exists error by retrying the command on failure.
This error typically happens when two or more instances of the Fern CLI are running `npx`
at the same time.


## 0.41.13
**`(fix):`** `fern generate --local` no longer crashes on large API Definitions because we
stream the JSON to file instead of calling `JSON.stringify`. See [PR 4640](https://github.com/fern-api/fern/pull/4640).


## 0.41.12
**`(feat):`** Adds availability to inlined properties for HTTP Requests, Webhooks, and WebSockets for Fern Definition and OpenAPI.
You can add availability like so:

Fern Definition:

```yml
Request:
  name: InlineRequest
  properties:
    random:
      type: string
      availability: pre-release
```

OpenAPI:

```yml
requestBody:
content:
  application/json:
    schema:
      type: object
      properties:
        random:
          type: string
          x-fern-availability: beta
```


## 0.41.11
**`(feat):`** Adds availability and display-names to discriminated union values. Now, in your docs, you can mark your union values
with custom names and show their availability. You can do so by adding the following to your API definition:
```yml
MyUnionType:
  union:
    UnionValue1:
      docs: The first union value
      type: string
      display-name: Union Value One
      availability: beta
    UnionValue2:
      docs: The second union value
      type: integer
      display-name: Union Value Two
      availability: deprecated
```
