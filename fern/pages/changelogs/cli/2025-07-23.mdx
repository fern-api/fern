## 0.65.27
**`(feat):`** Support multiple 2XX responses on http endpoints.


## 0.48.0
**`(feat):`** Adds support for nullable types in the Fern definition, such as the following:

```yaml
types:
  User:
    properties:
      name: string
      email: nullable<string>
```


## 0.47.6
**`(feat):`** The IR now pulls in additional request properties from the OAuth getToken endpoint to support custom OAuth schemas.


## 0.47.5
**`(feat):`** Fixes an issue with broken link checking in the OpenAPI v2 parser.


## 0.47.4
**`(feat):`** Allows for creating nullable types and pass formats on strings using the OpenAPI v2 parser.


## 0.47.3
**`(feat):`** Add the JSON schema to the generators.yml file for validation and autocomplete.


## 0.47.2
**`(feat):`** The CLI now supports checking for broken links in your docs. You will see warnings in `fern check` if your docs link to any
page that can't be resolved, and the `--strict-broken-links` option will cause the command to fail (exit with a non-zero exit code) if
any broken links are found. You can also run the new command `fern docs broken-links` to only check for broken links (ignoring
other possible errors), with the `--strict` option to cause the command to fail if any broken links are found.


## 0.47.1
**`(feat):`** Fixes a bug where the OpenAPI parser stopped respecting the =`unions: v1` setting in your `generators.yml` which configures the parser to generate more
idiomatic discriminated unions.
```yml
api:
  specs:
    - openapi: ./path/to/openapi.yml
      settings:
        unions: v1
```


## 0.47.0
**`(feat):`** The CLI now supports publishing docs using the improved OpenAPI v2 parser. You can set `openapi-parser-v2: true`
in your `docs.yml` to use the new parser.


## 0.46.23
**`(feat):`** The CLI now validates that method and group name overrides in OpenAPI settings are not duplicated.


## 0.46.22
**`(feat):`** Support configuration of Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager in API Docs.


## 0.46.21
**`(fix):`** The CLI now supports the `prefer-undiscriminated-unions-with-literals` setting in OpenAPI settings.


## 0.46.20
**`(feat):`** The `fern init` command now supports a `--mintlify` option. You can pass in
the path to your `mint.json` and the Fern CLI will generate a fern documentation
website.


## 0.46.19
**`(fix):`** If a schema in OpenAPI or AsyncAPI has `additionalProperties: true` then the Fern CLI will now respect bringing in
example properties that are not defined in the schema. Previously, the CLI would skip them.


## 0.46.18
**`(fix):`** If an object or request is annotated with `extra-properties: true` then the user can provide an example that includes
extra properties that are no longer in the schema.

For example, check out this fern definition

```yml service.yml
types:
  Item:
    extra-properties: true
    properties:
      id: string


service:
  auth: false
  base-path: ""
  endpoints:
    create:
      method: POST
      path: /item
      request:
        name: CreateItemRequest
        body:
          extra-properties: true
          properties:
            id: string
      response:
        type: Item
      examples:
        - name: "Item"
          request:
            id: "123"
            foo: "bar" # extra property in the example
          response:
            body:
              id: "123"
              foo: "bar" # extra property in the example
```


## 0.46.17
**`(fix):`** Support parsing string values for boolean defaults in OpenAPI schemas.
* String values like "true" and "false" are now correctly parsed as boolean defaults.


## 0.46.16
**`(fix):`** Improve parsing of OpenAPI schemas with an array in the `type` property.
* If the array contains `"null"`, it is interpreted as nullable, and removed from the array.
* If there is only a single item in the array (after removing "null"), it previously defaulted to `unknown`, but now the specified type is used.


## 0.46.15
**`(fix):`** Fixed issue where user specified examples would be omitted in favor of autogenerated examples.


## 0.46.14
**`(fix):`** Boolean default values are now propagated from the Fern Definition through to docs generation.


## 0.46.13
**`(fix):`** Correctly omits readOnly query parameters during openapi to fern definition generation.


## 0.46.12
**`(fix):`** The CLI now handles parsing service level path parameters with descriptions.
This fixes a regression introduced in the CLI since versions 0.45.x.


## 0.46.11
**`(fix):`** Allow for configuring the depth of example generation in API Docs. For example,
if you want to generate optional properties that are 5 levels deep, you can add
the following configuration in your `generators.yml`

```yml generators.yml
api:
  specs:
    - openapi: ./openapi.json
      settings:
        example-generation:
          response:
            max-depth: 10
```


## 0.46.10
**`(fix):`** Correctly support AdditionalProperties on object schemas.


## 0.46.9
**`(fix):`** SDK generation no longer hard-fails on single example generation errors.


## 0.46.8
**`(fix):`** The CLI now auto generates SSE and JSON Streaming examples even if those are
not provided in the OpenAPI Spec or Fern Definition.


## 0.46.7
**`(fix):`** The generated Fern Definition now properly supports default values for query parameters.


## 0.46.6
**`(fix):`** The audiences property on WebSocket channels is now respected when filtering
the IR graph based on configured audiences.


## 0.46.5
**`(fix):`** The OpenAPI parser now deduplicates headers that appear in both security schemes and
operation-level headers to avoid duplicate header declarations.


## 0.46.4
**`(fix):`** The generated SSE examples always have `data` and `event` keys so that they are correct.


## 0.46.3
**`(fix):`** The Fern CLI now supports generating examples for streaming SSE (server-sent-event)
endpoints.


## 0.46.2
**`(feat):`** The Fern CLI now supports parsing a `logo` option from your frontmatter. If
you would like to override logo on a specific page you can do so by adding
the following:

```markdown intro.mdx
---
logo: /path/to/my/logo
---
```

or

```markdown intro.mdx
---
logo:
  light: /path/to/my/light/logo
  dark: /path/to/my/dark/logo
---
```


## 0.46.1
**`(fix):`** Add support for setting the `User-Agent` header value for Go generators.


## 0.46.0
**`(internal):`** No changes; promote `0.46.0-rc1` release candidate to minor version.

**`(fix):`** * Set `inline: true` for inline enums imported from OpenAPI.
* Set `inline: true` for maps generated from OpenAPI additionalProperties.


## 0.46.0-rc0
**`(feat):`** The Fern Definition now supports `bytes` as a response type.

```yml service.yml
  endpoints:
    download:
      response: bytes
```


## 0.45.4
**`(fix):`** Defaults are no longer set on datetimes when converting to docs shapes.

**`(fix):`** Add 'list' to reserved keywords for use in PHP generator.


## 0.45.0-rc48
**`(feat):`** OAuth Client Credential Auth Scheme now supports the ability to optionally
set token header and prefix fields for use with docs playground.

```yml api.yml
auth-schemes:
  OAuth:
    scheme: oauth
    type: client-credentials
    token-header: Fern-Authorization
    token-prefix: Fern-Bearer
    ...
```


## 0.45.0-rc47
**`(fix):`** Support SDK generation provided comma-delineated content-type values in OpenAPI specs.


## 0.45.0-rc46
**`(fix):`** The IR handles converting example unions that are aliases.

**`(fix):`** Fixed bug in the Conjure importer where query parameters were overwritten during endpoint parameter parsing.


## 0.45.0-rc39
**`(fix):`** The OpenAPI importer now supports correlating request and response examples by name. When an example name is shared
between a request body and response, they will be paired together in the generated Fern definition.


## 0.45.0-rc38
**`(fix):`** The OpenAPI importer now supports respecting readonly properties in schemas. When enabled, readonly properties will be excluded from request bodies for
POST/PUT/PATCH endpoints. To enable this, configure the setting in your `generators.yml`:

```yml
api:
 specs:
   - openapi: ./path/to/openapi.yml
     settings:
       respect-readonly-schemas: true
```


## 0.45.0-rc37
**`(internal):`** Support parsing alpha and beta version numbers of Fern generators

## 0.45.0-rc36
**`(fix):`** The OpenAPI importer now supports importing deep object query parameters. To do this, you will
need to configure a setting in your `generators.yml`

```yml
api:
 specs:
   - openapi: ./path/to/openapi.yml
     settings:
       object-query-paramaters: true
```


## 0.45.0-rc34
**`(internal):`** The CLI now recognizes the versions of the Go generator that require IRv53.


## 0.45.0-rc33
**`(feat):`** The Fern CLI now supports roles and viewers in your docs configuration, if you are on the enterprise plan for docs:

```yml docs.ym
roles:
  - internal
  - beta-users
  - enterprise-users

navigation:
  - section: Internal Section
    viewers:
      - internal
    contents:
      - page: Internal Page
        path: ./internal/page.mdx
```


## 0.45.0-rc32
**`(fix):`** The OpenAPI importer now supports reading endpoints that have application/x-www-form-urlencoded requests


## 0.45.0-rc31
**`(fix):`** The OpenAPI importer now parses webhook examples and generates examples for webhooks when none are provided.


## 0.45.0-rc30
**`(fix):`** The OpenAPI importer now parses the `examples` field for primitive schema types like `string`, `number`, `array` and `boolean`.


## 0.45.0-rc29
**`(feat):`** The OpenAPI importer now parses the `examples` field that may be present on OpenAPI 3.1 schemas.


## 0.45.0-rc28
**`(feat):`** The OpenAPI importer now skips headers in a case-insensitive way (e.g. both "Content-Type" and "content-type" are skipped).


## 0.45.0-rc27
**`(feat):`** The Conjure importer now brings in endpoint level descriptions.


## 0.45.0-rc26
**`(feat):`** `fern check` handles validating unions that contain base properties.


## 0.45.0-rc25
**`(internal):`** The Fern CLI temporarily does not support RBAC/Audiences (they will be added in again shortly).


## 0.45.0-rc24
**`(fix):`** `fern docs dev` now runs in Node 16 - Node 22 environments.


## 0.45.0-rc23

## 0.45.0-rc22
**`(fix):`** Fixes bug introduced in 0.45.0-rc20 where section children were dropped from the docs definition.


## 0.45.0-rc21
**`(feat):`** The Fern CLI now supports orphaned pages in your docs configuration.


**`(fix):`** The RBAC config model is now renamed to `roles` and `viewers`:

```yml docs.yml
roles:
  - internal

navigation:
  - section: Internal Section
    viewers:
      - internal
    contents:
      - page: Internal Page
        path: ./internal/page.mdx
```


## 0.45.0-rc20
**`(feat):`** The Fern CLI now supports audiences in your docs configuration:

```yml docs.yml
# all audiences must be declared at the top level
audiences:
  - internal

navigation:
  - section: Internal Section
    audience: internal # audience is optional
    contents:
      - page: Internal Page
        path: ./internal/page.mdx
```


## 0.45.0-rc19
**`(fix):`** - Respect `x-fern-ignore` extension in OpenAPI parameters.


## 0.45.0-rc18
**`(fix):`** - Add additional debug logging to the CLI when downloading docs preview bundle


## 0.45.0-rc17
**`(fix):`** - Improved union example generation by increasing depth for better handling of recursive structures.
- Updated Conjure importer to represent binary types as bytes for requests and file for responses in Fern.
- Added detailed error messages when 'fern docs dev' fails, accessible with --log-level debug.


## 0.45.0-rc16
**`(fix):`** The Conjure importer now correctly keys the union subvariant by the property of the discriminant.

```conjure
union:
  discriminant: type
  union:
    square: Square
    circle: Circle
```

is equal to the following Fern Definition:

```yml fern
union:
  discriminant: type
  types:
    square:
      type: Square
      key: square
    circle:
      type: Circle
      key: circle
```


## 0.45.0-rc15
**`(fix):`** The Conjure importer now correctly imports base-path and docs from your conjure definition.


## 0.45.0-rc14
**`(fix):`** The Fern CLI now uses a longer timeout to make HTTP requests, which should fix some flakyness with the docs registration process.


## 0.45.0-rc13
**`(fix):`** The Fern CLI now uses a longer timeout to make HTTP requests, which should fix some flakyness with the docs registration process.


## 0.45.0-rc12
**`(fix):`** Undiscriminated unions are now represented using `anyOf` in the generated JSON Schema
Nullable properties are now correctly propagated to the JSON Schema


## 0.45.0-rc11
**`(fix):`** Improved JSON Schema generation for object inheritance:
- Removed the use of `allOf` for representing object extensions
- Properties from parent objects are now directly added to the child object in the JSON Schema


## 0.45.0-rc10
**`(fix):`** Added support for `additionalProperties` on export to JSON Schema.


## 0.45.0-rc9
**`(fix):`** Improved JSON Schema generation for object extensions and const values:
- Object extensions are now properly represented using `allOf` in the JSON Schema
- Literal values (string and boolean) are now correctly represented using `const` in the JSON Schema


## 0.45.0-rc8
**`(internal):`** Add `#!/usr/bin/env node` to the CLI to prevent runtime errors.


## 0.45.0-rc7
**`(internal):`** Stop minifying the CLI to prevent javascript runtime errors.


## 0.45.0-rc6
**`(fix):`** Update the CLI package.json to include the correct files.


## 0.45.0-rc5
**`(feat):`** Introduce a new command `fern jsonschema <output-file> --type <type-name>`
that outputs the JSON Schema for a given type in your Fern Definition.

```sh
fern jsonschema ./schema.json --type MyType
```


## 0.45.0-rc4
**`(chore):`** SCIM has been added as a common initialism.


## 0.45.0-rc3
**`(fix):`** Numerous fixes to the Conjure API Importer such as reading in request bodies and query parameters.


## 0.45.0-rc2
**`(fix):`** The CLI now generates endpoint examples for undiscriminated unions that are recursive.


## 0.45.0-rc1
**`(fix):`** The OpenAPI importer now generates streaming examples based on OpenAPI examples.


## 0.45.0-rc0
**`(fix):`** The Docs now support rendering `additionalProperties` in the API Playground so that users can send out arbitrary key,value pairs.


## 0.44.11
**`(fix):`** Several improvements to the conjure importer.

## 0.44.10
**`(fix):`** API update now supports consuming the API origin from spec V2 configurations.


## 0.44.9
**`(feat):`** The fern definition now supports descriptions supplied on request and response bodies.
You can enable this by simply supplying `docs` in your fern definition, or `description`
in your OpenAPI spec.


## 0.44.8
**`(fix):`** API Configuration V2 schema now takes in `origin` as well, allowing `fern api update` to function as expected in the new config.


## 0.44.7
**`(internal):`** The Fern CLI command `fern generator list` now accepts filters for the output mode, for example, you may now specify `fern generator list --excluded-modes local-file-system`
in order to filter any generators from the list that are outputting locally.


## 0.44.6
**`(fix):`** The Fern Definition respects endpoint level base-path overrides when validating examples.


## 0.44.5
**`(feat):`** The Fern Definition now supports overriding `base-path` at the endpoint level.
This is useful if you have subset of endpoints that do not live at the
configured base-path.

```yml imdb.yml
service:
  endpoints:
    getMovie:
      method: POST
      base-path: "latest/" # overrides the base-path configured in api.yml
      path: "movies/{movieId}"
```


## 0.44.4
**`(fix):`** Fern's OpenAPI importer will now handle generating examples for declared
errors so that they show up in the generated documentation.


## 0.44.3
**`(feat):`** Fern's OpenAPI importer can now handle `readOnly` properties in the top level
request schema. Note that Fern does not handle nested `readOnly` properties
just yet; please file a GitHub issue if this is important!


## 0.44.2
**`(fix):`** Fern's OpenAPI importer can now handle multiple error schemas for the
same status code.


## 0.44.1
**`(feat):`** The OpenAPI importer used to try and coerce all enums into a literals.
In some cases this is not desirable, so we now expose an option called
`coerce-enums-to-literals` in your generators.yml.

```yml generators.yml
api:
  specs:
    - openapi: ../openapi.json
      overrides: ../openapi-overrides.yml
      settings:
        title-as-schema-name: false
        coerce-enums-to-literals: false
```


## 0.44.0-rc0
**`(feat):`** The Fern CLI now supports parsing [Conjure](https://github.com/palantir/conjure), Palantir's
home-grown API Definition format.

If you know a company that is using Conjure that wants API Docs + SDKs, send them our way!


## 0.43.8
**`(fix):`** Any markdown files that have custom components are also pushed up to the Fern Docs
platform.


## 0.43.7
**`(fix):`** The `valid-markdown` rule has been updated to try and parse the markdown file into a
valid AST. If the file fails to parse, `fern check` will log an error as well
as the path to the markdown.


## 0.43.6
**`(fix):`** The OpenAPI importer now appropriately brings in responses that are under the `text/event-stream`
Content-Type if your endpoint is annotated with `x-fern-streaming`.
If your endpoint is not annotated with `x-fern-streaming`, then the response will be ignored.


## 0.43.5
**`(fix):`** If you use the `x-fern-streaming` extension and want to provide different descriptions
for the streaming endpoint, then you can now specify `streaming-description`.

```yml openapi.yml
x-fern-streaming:
  stream-condition: $request.stream
  stream-description: The streaming version of this endpoint returns a series of chunks ...
  response:
    $ref: #/components/schemas/Response
  stream-response:
    $ref: #/components/schemas/ResponseChunk
```


## 0.43.4
**`(fix):`** The OpenAPI parser now respects the content type in your OpenAPI spec, instead of always sending
`application/json`. With this upgrade, your SDKs will also start to send the correct content type.


## 0.43.3
**`(chore):`** The CLI now passes in the API definition ID once again, this is necessary so that generated snippet templates
may reference schemas within the API. This was a regression that was recently introduced.


## 0.43.2
**`(fix):`** The CLI now prints which API cannot be registered if `fern generate --docs` fails.


## 0.43.1
**`(feat):`** The CLI now supports running OpenAPI generator 0.1.0 with IR version 53.


## 0.43.0
**`(feat):`** The CLI now recognizes the fern-php-sdk generator.


## 0.42.15
**`(internal):`** The documentation resolver now appropriately creates a unique identifier for changelog sections. Previously, if you had multiple
changelogs within the same section, despite their title and slug being different, they would be treated as the same section since the ID
only took into account the parents' slug, appended the word "changelog" and that was all.

As a result previously all changelogs within the same section would get highlighted when one was selected, now only the selected changelog
is highlighted.


## 0.42.14
**`(fix):`** The OpenAPI importer now correctly propagates the title field on `oneof` schemas.


## 0.42.13
**`(fix):`** Example generation now intelligently truncates container examples, for example if the depth limit will be reached on a list of objects,
the list will be returned as an empty list, as opposed the previous behavior where an unknown object would be created.


## 0.42.12
**`(fix):`** Previously, deploying docs from Windows machines led to bad asset paths.
Now, the CLI respects Windows paths during run and web paths for retrieving
assets.


## 0.42.11
**`(fix):`** The API V2 configuration now supports disabling using titles as schema
names. You may want to disable this flag if your OpenAPI adds the same
title to multiple schemas.

```
api:
  specs:
    - openapi: /path/to/openapi
      settings:
        use-title-as-schema-name: false
```


## 0.42.10
**`(fix):`** Previously, the OpenAPI converter would bring over `title` on every
single property. This field is extraneous, so now we ignore it.


## 0.42.9
**`(fix):`** Previously, the OpenAPI importer would ignore skip parsing arbitrary
content types "*/*". Now it treats this content type as application/json.

```json openapi.json
"responses": {
  "200": {
    "description": "Success reply",
    "content": {
      "*/*": {
```


## 0.42.8
**`(fix):`** The API V2 configuration (in beta) now supports global header overrides.
This fixes a bug where those header overrides were getting dropped in
certain cases.

```yml generators.yml
api:
  headers:
    X-API-VERSION: string
  specs:
    - openapi: /path/to/openapi
      overrides: /path/to/overrides
```


## 0.42.7
**`(feat):`** The API V2 configuration (in beta) now supports global header
overrides. To specify global headers that are not in your
OpenAPI spec, simply add the following block in your `generators.yml`:

```yml generators.yml
api:
  headers:
    X-API-VERSION: string
  specs:
    - openapi: /path/to/openapi
      overrides: /path/to/overrides
```


## 0.42.6
**`(fix):`** Removes extraneous conditional error within namespacing configuration

## 0.42.5
**`(feat):`** Adds additional metadata retrievable by `fern generator get` so you can now get the language and the target repo.

## 0.42.4
**`(fix):`** Namespaced APIs now:
  - No longer contain duplicative nesting of some endpoint within another package of the same name as the namespace
  - Respect the `x-fern-sdk-group-name` annotation for endpoints


## 0.42.3
**`(fix):`** The OpenAPI importer now supports handling encoding on multipart requests.
Previously, the generators would not respect the `contentType` field for
each form input. But, now they do.
```yml
requestBody:
  content:
    multipart/form-data:
      schema:
        type: object
        properties:
          file:
            type: string
            format: binary
            description: The file to upload
      encoding:
        file:
          contentType: "application/octet-stream"
```


**`(fix):`** The OpenAPI importer now correctly parses descriptions of multipart
form requests. Previously these descriptions would be ignored.

For example, previously the description `The file to upload` would be
ignored in the example below.
```yml
requestBody:
  content:
    multipart/form-data:
      schema:
        type: object
        properties:
          file:
            type: string
            format: binary
            description: The file to upload
```


## 0.42.2
**`(fix):`** Error bodies are now appropriately namespaced as well!

## 0.42.1
**`(fix):`** Make sure to check for optionality when parsing stdout and stderr in CLI. This
removes the error: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'includes')`.


## 0.42.0
**`(fix):`** If you merge multiple OpenAPI specs with namespaces, `fern check` will no longer
complain about duplicate schema names across namespaces.
In the example below, both OpenAPI specs can have duplicative schema names and
that is okay.
```yml
api:
  specs:
    - openapi: openapi-bar.yml
      namespace: bar
    - openapi: openapi-foo.yml
      namespace: foo
```


## 0.41.16
**`(fix):`** Previously the OpenAPI converter would incorrectly mark
the values of `additionalProperties` as optional. Now, we have
introduced a feature flag to turn this behavior off.

The feature flag can be configured in generators.yml:
```yml
api:
  specs:
    - openapi: /path/to/openapi
      settings:
        optional-additional-properties: false
```


## 0.41.15
**`(internal):`** Performance improvements for stringifiying large Intermediate Representations. If
you have a large OpenAPI spec or Fern Definition, this can potentially shave off
minutes from `fern generate`.


## 0.42.0-rc0
**`(feat):`** The Fern Definition now supports `conten-type` on multipart request properties.
For example, to specify an `application/octet-stream` and `application/json`
contnet types, use the snippet below:

```ts
service:
  endpoints:
    upload:
      request:
        body:
          properties:
            file:
              type: file
              content-type: application/octet-stream
            metadata:
              type: unknown
              content-type: application/json
```


## 0.41.14-rc2
**`(internal):`** Remove bang operator and fix eslint warning in `compatible-ir-versions.ts`.

## 0.41.14-rc1
**`(feat):`** Running `fern check` will now check to confirm that the generator versions you are running are compatible with your Fern CLI version.

Each version of SDK generators depends on a version of a library that is exported by the Fern CLI, and as a result, each generator has a minimum
compatible version of the Fern CLI. As an example, if you were to run `fern check` while leveraging `fernapi/fern-python-sdk` version `2.0.0`, on CLI version `0.1.3`, you'd receive the following error:

`The generator fernapi/fern-python-sdk requires CLI version 0.23.0-rc4 or later (current version: 0.1.3-rc0).`

Indicating that you must upgrade your CLI in order to leverage the current generator.


### What's new
- Running `fern check` will now check to confirm that the generator versions you are running are compatible with your Fern CLI version.
- Fern commands now print out generator upgrades, in addition to CLI upgrades.

## 0.41.14-rc0
**`(fix):`** The Fern CLI now safely handles a npx file exists error by retrying the command on failure.
This error typically happens when two or more instances of the Fern CLI are running `npx`
at the same time.


## 0.41.13
**`(fix):`** `fern generate --local` no longer crashes on large API Definitions because we
stream the JSON to file instead of calling `JSON.stringify`. See [PR 4640](https://github.com/fern-api/fern/pull/4640).


## 0.41.12
**`(feat):`** Adds availability to inlined properties for HTTP Requests, Webhooks, and WebSockets for Fern Definition and OpenAPI.
You can add availability like so:

Fern Definition:

```yml
Request:
  name: InlineRequest
  properties:
    random:
      type: string
      availability: pre-release
```

OpenAPI:

```yml
requestBody:
content:
  application/json:
    schema:
      type: object
      properties:
        random:
          type: string
          x-fern-availability: beta
```


## 0.41.11
**`(feat):`** Adds availability and display-names to discriminated union values. Now, in your docs, you can mark your union values
with custom names and show their availability. You can do so by adding the following to your API definition:
```yml
MyUnionType:
  union:
    UnionValue1:
      docs: The first union value
      type: string
      display-name: Union Value One
      availability: beta
    UnionValue2:
      docs: The second union value
      type: integer
      display-name: Union Value Two
      availability: deprecated
```


## 0.41.10
**`(feat):`** Adds availability and display-names to discriminated union values. Now, in your docs, you can mark your union values
with custom names and show their availability. You can do so by adding the following to your API definition:
```yml
MyUnionType:
  union:
    UnionValue1:
      docs: The first union value
      type: string
      display-name: Union Value One
      availability: beta
    UnionValue2:
      docs: The second union value
      type: integer
      display-name: Union Value Two
      availability: deprecated
```


## 0.41.9
**`(internal):`** Adds a `bundle-path` hidden parameter for `fern docs dev` for use with `fern-platform` testing. You can pass the
path on the command line as an optional parameter.


## 0.41.8
**`(feat):`** The Fern generators.yml configuration now supports a new format for namespacing APIs for additional flexibility:

```yml
api:
  specs:
    - openapi: path/to/v1/openapi
      overrides: path/to/v1/overrides
      namespace: v1
    - openapi: path/to/v2/openapi
      overrides: path/to/v2/overrides
      namespace: v2
```

Through namespacing your API, you can have multiple objects and endpoints with the same name across different namespaces. You can think of them
as the equivalent to Python modules or TypeScript packages.
