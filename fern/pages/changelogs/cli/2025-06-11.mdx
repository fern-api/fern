## 0.64.4
**`(fix):`** Dont use posthog when CLI is running from self-hosted container.


## 0.64.3
**`(fix):`** The OpenAPI v3 Parser now uniquely stores schemas across endpoint parameters to prevent overwriting. Previously, 
schemas with the same name across different parameters would overwrite each other, leading to potential data loss 
and incorrect type definitions. This fix ensures that each parameter's schema is properly preserved and referenced 
throughout the API specification.


## 0.64.2
**`(fix):`** The AsyncAPI v3 importer now properly detects query parameters by analyzing the channel address specification. 
When a channel address contains a parameter reference in the format `={paramName}`, the importer will automatically 
identify it as a query parameter. This allows for more accurate parameter type detection and better handling of 
WebSocket channel parameters in AsyncAPI v3 specifications.


## 0.64.1
**`(fix):`** The AsyncAPI importer now supports parameter references and computing location of the parameter based on the address. 
This allows for more flexible parameter definitions in AsyncAPI specifications, where parameters can be referenced from other 
parts of the specification and their location can be dynamically determined based on the channel address.
