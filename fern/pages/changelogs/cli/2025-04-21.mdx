## 0.57.32
**`(feat):`** Improve server handling in OpenAPI imports by exploding servers with enum variables into multiple servers, 
one for each enum value. For example, a server with URL "https://{region}.example.com" where region 
is an enum ["us", "eu"] will be exploded into two servers: "https://us.example.com" and "https://eu.example.com".
