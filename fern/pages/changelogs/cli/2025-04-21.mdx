**`(feat):`** Objects use property schema examples when generating examples; request and response examples are generated with
optional properties included.

Single element type arrays will resolve to the single element in the example.


## 0.57.33
**`(feat):`** Improve OpenRPC response example generation by wrapping example payloads in JSON-RPC 2.0 format with metadata 
(jsonrpc version and request id). This ensures generated examples match the actual JSON-RPC response format.


## 0.57.32
**`(feat):`** Improve server handling in OpenAPI imports by exploding servers with enum variables into multiple servers, 
one for each enum value. For example, a server with URL "https://{region}.example.com" where region 
is an enum ["us", "eu"] will be exploded into two servers: "https://us.example.com" and "https://eu.example.com".
