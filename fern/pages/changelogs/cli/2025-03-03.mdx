## 0.56.0-rc6
**`(fix):`** Hidden sections are now removed from the docs sitemap. 

## 0.56.0-rc5
**`(fix):`** Fixed duplicate validation messages in docs validation by deduplicating violations 
that have the same message, node path, file path, and severity. 

This prevents showing the same broken link error multiple times.
