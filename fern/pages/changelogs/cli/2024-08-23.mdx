**`(fix):`** object declarations with extends and no properties now has examples propagating in the Docs and SDKs

### What's been fixed
- Previously, object declarations with extends and no properties did not have examples
propagating in the Docs and SDKs. The core issue was in IR generation which has now
been resolved.

The following will now work as expected:

```yaml
types:

  ObjectWithNoProperties:
    extends:
      - ParentA
      - ParentB
    examples:
      - name: Default
        value:
          propertyFromParentA: foo
          propertyFromParentB: bar
```
