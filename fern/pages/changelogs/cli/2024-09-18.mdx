## 0.42.8
**`(fix):`** The API V2 configuration (in beta) now supports global header overrides.
This fixes a bug where those header overrides were getting dropped in
certain cases.

```yml generators.yml
api:
  headers:
    X-API-VERSION: string
  specs:
    - openapi: /path/to/openapi
      overrides: /path/to/overrides
```


## 0.42.7
**`(feat):`** The API V2 configuration (in beta) now supports global header
overrides. To specify global headers that are not in your
OpenAPI spec, simply add the following block in your `generators.yml`:

```yml generators.yml
api:
  headers:
    X-API-VERSION: string
  specs:
    - openapi: /path/to/openapi
      overrides: /path/to/overrides
```


## 0.42.6
**`(fix):`** Removes extraneous conditional error within namespacing configuration

## 0.42.5
**`(feat):`** Adds additional metadata retrievable by `fern generator get` so you can now get the language and the target repo.

## 0.42.4
**`(fix):`** Namespaced APIs now:
  - No longer contain duplicative nesting of some endpoint within another package of the same name as the namespace
  - Respect the `x-fern-sdk-group-name` annotation for endpoints


## 0.42.3
**`(fix):`** The OpenAPI importer now supports handling encoding on multipart requests.
Previously, the generators would not respect the `contentType` field for
each form input. But, now they do.
```yml
requestBody:
  content:
    multipart/form-data:
      schema:
        type: object
        properties:
          file:
            type: string
            format: binary
            description: The file to upload
      encoding:
        file:
          contentType: "application/octet-stream"
```


**`(fix):`** The OpenAPI importer now correctly parses descriptions of multipart
form requests. Previously these descriptions would be ignored.

For example, previously the description `The file to upload` would be
ignored in the example below.
```yml
requestBody:
  content:
    multipart/form-data:
      schema:
        type: object
        properties:
          file:
            type: string
            format: binary
            description: The file to upload
```


## 0.42.2
**`(fix):`** Error bodies are now appropriately namespaced as well!
