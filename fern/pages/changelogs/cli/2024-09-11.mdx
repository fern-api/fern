## 0.41.10
**`(feat):`** Adds availability and display-names to discriminated union values. Now, in your docs, you can mark your union values
with custom names and show their availability. You can do so by adding the following to your API definition:
```yml
MyUnionType:
  union:
    UnionValue1:
      docs: The first union value
      type: string
      display-name: Union Value One
      availability: beta
    UnionValue2:
      docs: The second union value
      type: integer
      display-name: Union Value Two
      availability: deprecated
```
