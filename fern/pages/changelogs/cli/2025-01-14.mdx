## 0.49.0
**`(feat):`** The OpenAPI importer now supports respecting nullable properties in schemas. When enabled, nullable properties will
be preserved in the generated SDK. By default (without this setting), nullable properties are treated as `optional`.
To enable this, configure the setting in your `generators.yml`:

```yml
api:
 specs:
   - openapi: ./path/to/openapi.yml
     settings:
       respect-nullable-schemas: true
```
