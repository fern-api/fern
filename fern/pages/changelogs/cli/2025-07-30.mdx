## 0.65.37
**`(feat):`** Add support for snippet.json output as part of self hosted SDK generation. The following config in 
`generators.yml` will generate a `snippet.json` file in the relevant director: 
```
groups: 
  ts-sdk: 
    - name: fernapi/fern-typescript-sdk
      snippets: 
        path: ../snippets.json
```
