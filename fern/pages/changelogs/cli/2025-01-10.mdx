## 0.47.2
**`(feat):`** The CLI now supports checking for broken links in your docs. You will see warnings in `fern check` if your docs link to any
page that can't be resolved, and the `--strict-broken-links` option will cause the command to fail (exit with a non-zero exit code) if
any broken links are found. You can also run the new command `fern docs broken-links` to only check for broken links (ignoring
other possible errors), with the `--strict` option to cause the command to fail if any broken links are found.
