## 0.42.15
**`(internal):`** The documentation resolver now appropriately creates a unique identifier for changelog sections. Previously, if you had multiple
changelogs within the same section, despite their title and slug being different, they would be treated as the same section since the ID
only took into account the parents' slug, appended the word "changelog" and that was all.

As a result previously all changelogs within the same section would get highlighted when one was selected, now only the selected changelog
is highlighted.
