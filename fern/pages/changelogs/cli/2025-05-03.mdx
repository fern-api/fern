## 0.60.8
**`(feat):`** Add support for environment and auth overrides from generators.yml in the OpenAPI parser. When importing OpenAPI specifications, 
the parser now checks for environment and auth configurations in the generators.yml file and uses these settings to override 
the environments and authentication schemes defined in the OpenAPI document. This enhancement provides more flexibility in 
customizing imported APIs without modifying the original OpenAPI specification, allowing for environment-specific configurations 
and standardized authentication schemes across different API versions.
