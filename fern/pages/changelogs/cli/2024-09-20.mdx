## 0.42.14
**`(fix):`** The OpenAPI importer now correctly propagates the title field on `oneof` schemas.


## 0.42.13
**`(fix):`** Example generation now intelligently truncates container examples, for example if the depth limit will be reached on a list of objects,
the list will be returned as an empty list, as opposed the previous behavior where an unknown object would be created.


## 0.42.12
**`(fix):`** Previously, deploying docs from Windows machines led to bad asset paths.
Now, the CLI respects Windows paths during run and web paths for retrieving
assets.
