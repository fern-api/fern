## 0.46.2
**`(feat):`** The Fern CLI now supports parsing a `logo` option from your frontmatter. If
you would like to override logo on a specific page you can do so by adding
the following:

```markdown intro.mdx
---
logo: /path/to/my/logo
---
```

or

```markdown intro.mdx
---
logo:
  light: /path/to/my/light/logo
  dark: /path/to/my/dark/logo
---
```
