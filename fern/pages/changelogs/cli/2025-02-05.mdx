## 0.51.31
**`(internal):`** The IR migrator now recognizes that the PHP SDK generator requires IR version 55.


## 0.51.30
**`(fix):`** The OpenAPI v2 parser now provides better naming and more robust payloads for examples.


## 0.51.29
**`(fix):`** The images will be rendered to browser in the format of image ID that matches FileV2.
It ensure images will be displayed properly in dev environment.


## 0.51.28
**`(fix):`** The IR generator now optimizes SDK generation by skipping automatic example generation when manual examples are provided.
Previously, it would generate additional examples even when manual examples were specified for an operation.
This change improves generation performance by avoiding unnecessary example generation work.


## 0.51.27
**`(fix):`** The OpenAPI parser now optimizes discriminated union example generation by using the first successful variant.
Previously, it would continue trying other variants even after finding a valid one. Now it stops after finding
the first valid variant, making example generation more efficient.


## 0.51.26
**`(fix):`** The OpenAPI parser now correctly generates examples for discriminated unions where a variant may itself be a union.
Previously, if a discriminated union variant was itself a union (e.g. `{ type: "foo", value: { type: "bar" } }`),
the example generation would skip. Now it recursively handles nested unions to generate valid examples.
