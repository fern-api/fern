## 0.57.9
**`(fix):`** Add support for reading common properties across all oneOf variants in the new OpenAPI parser. When a schema uses `oneOf` with a discriminator, the parser now correctly extracts and includes properties defined at the root level of the schema as base properties of the discriminated union. This ensures that common fields shared by all variants are properly represented in the generated IR.


## 0.57.8
**`(fix):`** Bump undici timeouts to make sure docs sites get published. This addresses an issue where large documentation sites were timing out during the publishing process. By increasing the timeout values for the undici HTTP client, we ensure that even complex documentation sites have enough time to complete the publishing process.


## 0.57.7
**`(fix):`** Add support for `anyOf` in the new OpenAPI parser. This allows for undiscriminated unions in the OpenAPI schema, where a type can be one of several possible types without a discriminator field. The parser now handles both `oneOf` and `anyOf` schemas in the same way, converting them to undiscriminated unions in the IR.


## 0.57.6
**`(fix):`** Reduce CLI output from the legacy OpenAPI parser when using the experimental `openapiParserV3` option. This makes the logs cleaner and more focused on relevant information when using the newer parser.
