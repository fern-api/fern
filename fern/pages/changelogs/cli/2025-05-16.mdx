## 0.61.17
**`(fix):`** Add support for preserving `maxLines` and `focus` attributes when using "`<Code src=\"...\" />`" components in docs. 
These attributes are now properly carried over to the generated code blocks, allowing you to control 
the display of referenced code snippets with features like line limits and syntax highlighting focus.
