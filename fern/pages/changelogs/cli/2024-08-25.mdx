## 0.39.19
**`(fix):`** The OpenAPI importer now appropriately generates examples for circular `oneOf` schemas.

### What's been fixed
- The OpenAPI importer now handles generating examples for referenced `oneOf` schemas. Previously, examples generation would fail.
- The OpenAPI importer now handles generating examples for circular `oneOf` schemas. Previously, the
the converter would only default to generating examples for the first `oneOf` schema. If the first variant,
circularly referenced itself, this would make terminating the example impossible.
Now, the example generator tries every schema in order, guaranteeing that a termination condition will be
reached.
