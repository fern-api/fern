## 0.64.21
**`(feat):`** Introduce `x-fern-discriminated` extension to configure oneOf union behavior in OpenAPI specs.

```yaml
# Example usage in OpenAPI schema
oneOf:
  - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Circle'
  - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Square'
x-fern-discriminated: false  # Treat as undiscriminated union
```

When `x-fern-discriminated` is set to `false`, the oneOf will be treated as an undiscriminated union instead of a discriminated union.
