## 0.56.0-rc2
**`(fix):`** Fix an issue where channel binding parameters with complex schemas were generated with conflicting names.


## 0.56.0-rc1
**`(internal):`** Add support for a new option `--from-openapi` to the `fern ir` command. This command
will allow you to test early versions of the new OpenAPI parser which goes directly from
OpenAPI to IR.

```bash
fern ir ir.json --from-openapi
```


## 0.56.0-rc0
**`(feat):`** Improve the `fern docs broken-links` output to make it easier to
understand. Logged violations now include clickable links to the
affected source files (in supported terminals).

Added a `--broken-links` flag to the `fern check` and `fern docs dev`
commands. If set, broken links will be logged.


## 0.55.1
**`(fix):`** The Conjure Importer now correctly handles the `auth` property in endpoint definitions.
