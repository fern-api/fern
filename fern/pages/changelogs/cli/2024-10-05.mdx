## 0.44.1
**`(feat):`** The OpenAPI importer used to try and coerce all enums into a literals.
In some cases this is not desirable, so we now expose an option called
`coerce-enums-to-literals` in your generators.yml.

```yml generators.yml
api:
  specs:
    - openapi: ../openapi.json
      overrides: ../openapi-overrides.yml
      settings:
        title-as-schema-name: false
        coerce-enums-to-literals: false
```
