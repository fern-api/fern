## 0.61.18
**`(fix):`** Fix OpenRPC converter to use proper breadcrumbs when generating request and response schemas. 
This ensures that schemas with the same name but different contexts (such as parameters and results) 
don't overwrite each other during conversion, maintaining the integrity of the API definition.


## 0.61.17
**`(fix):`** Add support for preserving `maxLines` and `focus` attributes when using `<Code src="..." />` components in docs. 
These attributes are now properly carried over to the generated code blocks, allowing you to control 
the display of referenced code snippets with features like line limits and syntax highlighting focus.


## 0.61.16
**`(fix):`** Fix docs preview server by properly killing the Next.js process on exit and setting 
a memory limit (--max-old-space-size=2048) to prevent out-of-memory errors during development.


## 0.61.15
**`(fix):`** Example pairing operates on example summary fields.


## 0.61.14
**`(fix):`** Exclude deprecated fields from examples.


## 0.61.13
**`(fix):`** Introduce `fern check --from-openapi` which prints out validation errors directly from OpenAPI
as well as the corresponding line numbers originating the errors.


## 0.61.12
**`(feat):`** When you set `type-dates-as-strings` to `false` in the OpenAPI `settings` in _generators.yml_,
schemas of type `string` with format `date` will be converted to a Fern `date` type, instead of a `string` type.


## 0.61.11
**`(fix):`** Fix an issue where a singular allOf circular reference would lead to an infinite loop in the v3 parser.
