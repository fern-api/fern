## 0.51.25
**`(fix):`** Literal property values are now accepted as deep object query parameters. Previously, if a query parameter was a deep object
with a literal property value (e.g. `{ type: "foo" }`), the CLI would reject it as too complex. Now literal values are
allowed since they can be safely serialized.


## 0.51.24
**`(fix):`** The OpenAPI parser now parses path parameters that are present in the URL but not explicitly declared in the OpenAPI spec.
Previously, if a path parameter was used in the URL (e.g. `/users/{userId}`) but not declared in the `parameters` section,
the parser would fail. Now it automatically adds these path parameters as required string parameters.


## 0.51.23
**`(fix):`** The CLI now considers `false` and `true` as keywords for the Java generators.


## 0.51.22
**`(fix):`** The OpenAPI parser now ignores request bodies on `GET` requests since Fern does not support that.
This is not a breaking change, since previously the `fern check` would just fail.


## 0.51.21
**`(fix):`** The `fern init` command now respects JSON formatting when parsing from an external URL.
