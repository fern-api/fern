## 0.51.28
**`(fix):`** The IR generator now optimizes SDK generation by skipping automatic example generation when manual examples are provided.
Previously, it would generate additional examples even when manual examples were specified for an operation.
This change improves generation performance by avoiding unnecessary example generation work.


## 0.51.27
**`(fix):`** The OpenAPI parser now optimizes discriminated union example generation by using the first successful variant.
Previously, it would continue trying other variants even after finding a valid one. Now it stops after finding
the first valid variant, making example generation more efficient.


## 0.51.26
**`(fix):`** The OpenAPI parser now correctly generates examples for discriminated unions where a variant may itself be a union.
Previously, if a discriminated union variant was itself a union (e.g. `{ type: "foo", value: { type: "bar" } }`),
the example generation would skip. Now it recursively handles nested unions to generate valid examples.


## 0.51.25
**`(fix):`** Literal property values are now accepted as deep object query parameters. Previously, if a query parameter was a deep object
with a literal property value (e.g. `{ type: "foo" }`), the CLI would reject it as too complex. Now literal values are
allowed since they can be safely serialized.


## 0.51.24
**`(fix):`** The OpenAPI parser now parses path parameters that are present in the URL but not explicitly declared in the OpenAPI spec.
Previously, if a path parameter was used in the URL (e.g. `/users/{userId}`) but not declared in the `parameters` section,
the parser would fail. Now it automatically adds these path parameters as required string parameters.


## 0.51.23
**`(fix):`** The CLI now considers `false` and `true` as keywords for the Java generators.


## 0.51.22
**`(fix):`** The OpenAPI parser now ignores request bodies on `GET` requests since Fern does not support that.
This is not a breaking change, since previously the `fern check` would just fail.
