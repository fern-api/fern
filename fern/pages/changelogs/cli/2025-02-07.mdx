## 0.51.35
**`(fix):`** The cli will now respect examples with `null` values in OpenAPI specs. This will allow for null properties to show up when using
OpenAPI parser v2.


## 0.51.34
**`(fix):`** The IR generator now correctly handles exploded form parameters in the docs, ensuring that curl code snippets
accurately reflect the expected request format. Previously, exploded parameters were not properly formatted in the documentation, which
could lead to incorrect API usage. This fix ensures that array parameters marked as "exploded" are properly expanded in the generated curl examples.


## 0.51.33
**`(fix):`** The OpenAPI parser v2 now handles `null` values in examples, parses request and response bodies as unions if multiple, handles required
properties for global headers and improves upon example generation for APIs.
