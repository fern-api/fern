## 0.62.10
**`(internal):`** Add support for overriding auth in generators.yml. You can now specify auth for a specific generator by adding an `api` field with an `auth` property. For example:

```yaml
- name: fernapi/fern-typescript-sdk
  version: 0.48.5
  api: 
    auth: bearer
```

This will override the auth configuration for that specific generator while keeping the original auth configuration for other generators.


## 0.62.9
**`(internal):`** Re-release `0.62.7`


## 0.62.8
**`(internal):`** Re-release `0.62.7`


## 0.62.7
**`(fix):`** Remove `respect-readonly-schemas` for the legacy OpenAPI parser since it can block docs 
generation. Anyone who wants to enable this can turn it on in `generators.yml` or upgrade
to the latest OpenAPI parser.


## 0.62.6
**`(fix):`** Code samples provided via `x-fern-examples` will now be joined with autogenerated examples.


## 0.62.5
**`(fix):`** Parse `number` types as `double` instead of `integer`.
Empty objects are now interpreted as unnamed primitives in union schemas.
Update `x-fern-examples` to extract codeSamples in isolation from example request & responses.
Propagate `x-fern-examples` name to generated code samples.


## 0.62.4
**`(fix):`** Improve naming for discriminated unions based on title/discriminator key.
