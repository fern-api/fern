## 0.58.3
**`(feat):`** Enhance OpenAPI security scheme handling in the parser to support both global and endpoint-level security requirements. 
The parser now properly converts security schemes from OpenAPI's `securitySchemes` component into appropriate authentication 
headers, supporting bearer tokens, basic auth, and custom API key headers. Global security requirements defined at the 
document level are applied to all endpoints, while endpoint-specific security requirements override or supplement the 
global configuration, ensuring accurate authentication representation in generated SDKs.


## 0.58.4-rc0
**`(feat):`** Local development is now available for all machines using `fern-dev`.
