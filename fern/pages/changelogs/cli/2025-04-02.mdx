## 0.57.15
**`(fix):`** Add support for handling nullable and optional references in the OpenAPI parser. When a reference is marked with `nullable: true` or is not included in the required properties list, the parser now correctly wraps the referenced type in a nullable or optional container. This ensures that references respect the same nullability and optionality rules as inline schemas.


## 0.57.14
**`(chore):`** Adds support for the `command-a` model in AI chat, while removing support for the `command-r-plus` model.
