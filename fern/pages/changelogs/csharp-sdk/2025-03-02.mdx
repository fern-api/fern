## 1.13.0-rc0
**`(feat):`** Pager and BiPager now have consistent properties and methods.
As part of this change, pagers are now generated asynchronously which is a breaking change for the endpoint methods.

```csharp
// Before:
var pager = client.GetItemsAsync(...);

// After:
var pager = await client.GetItemsAsync(...);
```

## 1.12.0-rc1
**`(feat):`** Add support for the `include-exception-handler` configuration option, which generates an `ExceptionHandler` interface for the SDK.
This is useful when you want to act upon all exceptions thrown by the SDK (e.g. report them to a monitoring service).

You can configure this feature with the following:

```yaml
# generators.yml
- name: fern-api/fern-csharp-sdk
  version: 1.12.0-rc1
  config:
    include-exception-handler: true
```


**`(fix):`** Fixes a regression for mapping `ReadOnlyMemory` values in the generated Protobuf mapper.
