## 1.13.0-rc0
**`(feat):`** Pager and BiPager now have consistent properties and methods.
As part of this change, pagers are now generated asynchronously which is a breaking change for the endpoint methods.

```csharp
// Before:
var pager = client.GetItemsAsync(...);

// After:
var pager = await client.GetItemsAsync(...);
```
