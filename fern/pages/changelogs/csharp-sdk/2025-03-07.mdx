## 1.12.0-rc13
**`(feat):`** Add support for receiving additional properties in object types with the new `AdditionalProperties` field.
This is useful when you want to parse an object that has properties that are not available in the SDK
(e.g. alpha and/or undocumented properties).

```csharp
// Call the endpoint.
var response = await client.GetUser(...);

// Print the additional properties.
Console.WriteLine(response.AdditionalProperties);
```
