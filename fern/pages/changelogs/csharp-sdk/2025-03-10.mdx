## 1.12.0-rc18
**`(fix):`** Make the behavior between a wrapped request with body properties and normal body request consistent.
Previously, a wrapped request with body properties would not omit `null` values even if the JSON configuration is configured to omit `null` values.


**`(fix):`** Fix a bug where required properties that were `[JsonIgnore]` threw an error during serialization.


**`(feat):`** Improve performance of query string value to string conversion by relying less on `JsonSerializer` and more on `ToString()`.
