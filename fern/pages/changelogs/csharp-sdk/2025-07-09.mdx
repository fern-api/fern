## 2.1.0
**`(feat):`** Pass in custom pager context to the custom pager factory. The context contains the send request method, initial HTTP request, client options, and request options.
SDK authors can improve their custom pagination implementation with this context available to them.


## 2.0.3
**`(fix):`** Mockserver tests were generated based on the endpoint name being tested.
When multiple endpoints have the same name, they would override each other, resulting in only one of them being tested.
Mockserver tests are now namespaced and written to the filesystem following the same structure as the generated endpoints are.


**`(fix):`** Update the type referencing logic to take into account the current namespace, other namespaces, and more scenarios where it could conflicts.
