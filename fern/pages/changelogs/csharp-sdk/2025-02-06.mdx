## 1.9.21
**`(fix):`** Support literals in query parameters and headers. For example, if a field in a wrapped request has a literal value of "foo", we will now set that value as the default value for the field.
Note that wrapped requests are just a bag of properties that include body properties.


## 1.9.20
**`(fix):`** Support literals in wrapped requests (). For example, if a field in a wrapped request has a literal value of "foo", we will now set that value as the default value for the field.
Note that wrapped requests are just a bag of properties that include body properties.


## 1.9.19
**`(fix):`** Fix serialization of enum path parameters. Previously, enum path parameters were serialized using their C# enum name, but now they are
correctly serialized using their wire value.


## 1.9.18
**`(fix):`** Fix serialization of enum path parameters. Previously, enum path parameters were serialized using their C# enum name, but now they are
correctly serialized using their wire value.


## 1.9.17
**`(fix):`** Support required literals. For example, if a field has a literal value of "foo", we will now set that value as the default value for the field.


## 1.9.16
**`(fix):`** Required client parameters that are headers are now sent when making API requests. For example if a bearer token is required to
instantiate the client, we will ensure that it is sent when making API requests.


## 1.9.15
**`(fix):`** Change unpaged endpoints from internal to private to avoid ambiguous references in test projects who have access to internals.

**`(fix):`** Fix an issue where enum values named `Equals` would always have be converted to `"Equals"` instead of their correct wire value.


**`(feat):`** Increase test performance by parallelizing tests and setting HTTP request retry delay to 0.
