## 1.9.12
**`(fix):`** Change serialization logic for headers and querystring parameters:
- Strings, enums, dates, times, and date times are serialized as before.
- Booleans are now serialized as `true` and `false` instead of `True` and `False`.
- Objects, lists, maps, dictionaries, undiscriminated, and discriminated unions are serialized to JSON.


**`(fix):`** Only use `.Value` on nullable structs when serializing parameters to headers and querystring parameters.
