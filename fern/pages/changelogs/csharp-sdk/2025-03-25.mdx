## 1.15.11
**`(chore):`** Restructure internal HTTP classes to allow for more granular Fern ignoring.

**`(feat):`** Add `NdJsonContent` and `NdJsonRequest` classes to support NDJSON requests.
Currently, endpoints with NDJSON requests are not supported, but this aids manual implementation combined with Fern ignoring.
