## 1.13.0
**`(feat):`** Add support for multipartform requests with file and non-file parameters.
This is useful when you want to send a file along with other form data in a single request.

For example, you can use the following code to upload a file with a description and some metadata:
```csharp
await client.UploadAsync(
    new UploadRequest
    {
        File = new FileParameter { Stream = fileStream, FileName = "file.txt" },
        Description = "This is a test file",
        Meta = new Meta {
            Key1 = "value1",
            Key2 = "value2"
        }
    }
);
```
