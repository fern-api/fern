## 1.9.9
**`(feat):`** Add support for [Auto Pagination](https://buildwithfern.com/learn/sdks/features/auto-pagination).
When enabled, the endpoint methods will return a `Pager<T>` object that you can use to iterate over all items of an endpoint.
Additionally, you can use the `Pager<T>.AsPagesAsync` method to iterate over all pages of an endpoint.
The SDK will automatically make the necessary HTTP requests for you as you iterate over the items or the pages.
