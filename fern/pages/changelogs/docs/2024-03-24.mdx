## Virtualized Syntax Highlighting
Implemented performance-optimized code rendering that handles large code blocks efficiently without impacting page performance. Long code samples now load instantly and scroll smoothly.

## Mobile Search Experience
Redesigned the mobile search interface with a sticky search bar and improved results display. Users can now easily search documentation on mobile devices with a native-feeling interface.

```css
.mobile-search-container {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
  z-index: 50;
  backdrop-filter: blur(8px);
}
```

## Scrollbar Refinement
Enhanced scrollbar design and behavior across all documentation sections for a more polished look and feel. Scrollbars now adapt to both light and dark themes while maintaining usability.

```css
.custom-scrollbar {
  scrollbar-width: thin;
  scrollbar-color: var(--scrollbar) transparent;
}
```
