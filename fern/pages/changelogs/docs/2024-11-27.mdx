## Card Component System
Enhanced documentation card components for better visual organization. Information can now be presented in a more structured and appealing way.

```typescript
interface CardProps {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  icon?: IconName;
  variant?: 'default' | 'bordered' | 'filled';
  actions?: CardAction[];
}

interface CardAction {
  label: string;
  href?: string;
  onClick?: () => void;
}
```
