## Environment Testing Interface
Created an editable playground environment system for testing API endpoints. Users can now switch between different API environments seamlessly within the documentation.

```yaml openapi.yml
servers:
  - url: https://api.example.com
    x-fern-server-name: Production
  - url: https://sandbox.example.com
    x-fern-server-name: Sandbox
```

## Server Upload Validation
Improved file upload handling with better validation in documentation examples. Users can now better understand and test file upload endpoints.

```typescript
const uploadConfig = {
  maxSize: '10MB',
  allowedTypes: ['image/*', 'application/pdf'],
  validateBeforeUpload: true,
  showProgress: true
}
```
