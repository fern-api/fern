## Environment Testing Interface
Created an editable playground environment system for testing API endpoints. Users can now switch between different API environments seamlessly within the documentation.

```yaml openapi.yml
servers:
  - url: https://api.example.com
    x-fern-server-name: Production
  - url: https://sandbox.example.com
    x-fern-server-name: Sandbox
```
