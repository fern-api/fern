## Table of contents customization

We've added a `max-toc-depth` frontmatter option to control the depth of the table of contents. Use this to limit the heading ranks included in the table of contents.

You can read more about this feature in the [frontmatter documentation](/learn/docs/content/frontmatter#max-depth).
