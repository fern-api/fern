## 1.5.1
**`(fix):`** Enum headers are now correctly serialized in API requests. When an endpoint specifies an enum type for a header
parameter, the SDK will automatically serialize the enum value to its string representation as expected by the API.


## 1.5.0
**`(internal):`** Update the primary client to delegate to the new raw client to reduce code duplication.
