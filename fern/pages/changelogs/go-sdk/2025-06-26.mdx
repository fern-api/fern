## 1.3.0
**`(feat):`** Add support for receiving raw response headers from API calls with the new `WithRawResponse` client field.

```go
response, err := client.WithRawResponse.GetUser(...)
fmt.Printf("Got response headers: %v", response.Header)
```


**`(feat):`** Bump the minimum Go version to `1.18` because generics are now required by the SDK. Version 1.18 was
originally released over three years ago, so this is well within the official Go support window found
at https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy
