## 0.37.2
**`(fix):`** Fix an issue where the `go-v2` generator call prevented the `go` generator from succeeding in remote code generation environments.

## 0.37.1
**`(fix):`** Fix an issue where the primary Go files were not being written due to README.md generation.

## 0.37.0
**`(internal):`** Upgrade to IRv57.

**`(feat):`** Add support for automatic `README.md` generation.

## 0.36.5
**`(fix):`** Fix an issue where `map` values were not correctly serialized as deep object query parameters.

## 0.36.4
**`(fix):`** Fix an issue where the `go-v2` generator call prevented the `go` generator from succeeding in remote code generation environments.

## 0.36.3
**`(fix):`** Fix an issue where the version header specified by the user wasn't being used.

## 0.36.2
**`(fix):`** Fix cursor pagination stopping condition when the cursor types do not match (e.g. a `*string` cursor type with a `string` next cursor type).

## 0.36.1
**`(fix):`** Fix offset pagination method generation for non-integer offset parameters (e.g. `float64`).

## 0.36.0
**`(feat):`** Adds support for a few new configuration options, all of which are shown below:
```yaml - name: fern-api/fern-go-sdk
  version: 0.36.0
  config:
    packageLayout: flat
    clientName: Acme
    clientConstructorName: New
```
With this, the generated SDK will all be deposited at the root of the module, and the client can be constructed like so:
```go package main
import (
  "context"
  "fmt"
  "log"
  acme "github.com/acme/acme-go"
)
func main() {
  client := acme.New()
  response, err := client.GetUser(
    context.Background(),
    &acme.GetUserRequest{
      ID: "85307b0b-094b-41b5-b61d-347ca15e5da2",
    },
  )
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }
  fmt.Println(response)
} ```

## 0.35.2
**`(fix):`** Fixes an issue where certain literal string values were incorrectly generated in undiscriminated unions.

**`(fix):`** Fixes an issue where custom names applied to a basic auth scheme were not preserved.

## 0.35.1
**`(fix):`** Fixes an issue where the delimiter length was included during stream data read, even when the delimiter was missing, leading to a `bufio.ErrAdvanceTooFar` error

## 0.35.0
**`(feat):`** Add runtime validation for discriminated unions to prevent users from accidentally sending the wrong type of value. With this, users will be expected to set exactly one of the union's values like so:
```go package example
type Animal struct {
  Type string
  Cat  *Cat
  Dog  *Dog
}
func do() {
  union := &Animal{
    Cat: &Cat{
      Name: "Fluffy",
    },
  }
} ```
If the user sets _both_ `Cat` and `Dog`, the user will receive an error when the type is serialized to JSON (i.e. in the `json.Marshaler` implementation).

## 0.34.0
**`(feat):`** Add support for sending the `User-Agent` header on every request. Go packages are uniquely identified by their full module path, so the `User-Agent` header is generated in the `<module>/<version>` format, e.g.
``` User-Agent: github.com/acme/acme-go/1.0.0 ```

## 0.33.0
**`(feat):`** Add support for the `inlinePathParameters` configuration option, which generates path parameters in the generated request type (if any) instead of as separate positional parameters.
```yaml # generators.yml
- name: fern-api/fern-go-sdk
  version: 0.33.0
  config:
    inlinePathParameters: true
```

## 0.32.1
**`(internal):`** Improve the aesthetics of the generated code, and reduce the amount of repetition in each of the generated endpoints. This change has zero impact on the behavior of the generated SDK.

## 0.32.0
**`(feat):`** Add support for the `inlineFileProperties` configuration option, which generates file properties in the generated request type instead of as separate positional parameters.
```yaml # generators.yml
- name: fern-api/fern-go-sdk
  version: 0.32.0
  config:
    inlineFileProperties: true
```

**`(fix):`** Fixes an issue where the new `core.MultipartWriter` was generated for SDKs that didn't define any file upload endpoints.

**`(internal):`** Simplify the generated code from the new `core.MultipartWriter` introduced in 0.29.0 by refactoring `internal.WithMultipartContentType` as `internal.WithDefaultContentType`.

## 0.31.3
**`(fix):`** Updates the retrier to stop retrying on `409 Conflict` HTTP status codes by default.

## 0.31.2
**`(internal):`** Add an `internal` package, which now contains the internal functionality previously included in the `core` package (e.g. `core.Caller` -> `internal.Caller`).
Although technically a breaking change in terms of the module itself, this change was always the intention, and should have zero impact on users.
Any `core` type that is meant for public consumption remains in the exported `core` package (e.g. `core.APIError` and `core.RequestOption`).

## 0.31.1
**`(internal):`** Adds additional tests to confirm the behavior of the `core.Retrier`.
No functional, user-facing changes are included.

## 0.31.0
**`(feat):`** Improves type file layout with zero impact on backwards compatibility.
Shared types are now more accurately placed in the `types.go` file, whereas types referenced by a single service are now placed in a file that matches the service's filename (e.g. user.go).

## 0.30.0
**`(feat):`** Add support for nil-safe getter methods. Callers can more easily access nested properties by chaining together getter method calls instead of a long series of `!= nil` checks.

## 0.29.0
**`(feat):`** All SDKs now include an exported `FileParam` type that can be used to configure the `Content-Type` of file upload properties.

**`(fix):`** Resolves an issue where multipart/form-data lists were incorrectly serialized as JSON. They are now added as individual parts.

**`(internal):`** Refactor file upload endpoint generation with the new `core.MultipartWriter`. This significantly improves the aesthetics of the generated code.

## 0.28.3
**`(internal):`** Upgrade to IRv53.

## 0.28.2
**`(fix):`** Fix an issue where undiscriminated unions were not round-trippable whenever the union is the zero value of the type (e.g. `0` for `int`).

## 0.28.1
**`(fix):`** Fix an issue where optional, allow-multiple query parameter snippets were not rendered.

**`(fix):`** Fix an issue where service headers were not included in the generated in-lined request.

**`(fix):`** Fix an issue where literal types were included as path parameter arguments.

## 0.28.0
**`(feat):`** Add support for the exportedClientName configuration, which can be used to customize the generated client name and constructor included in snippets.
Note that this configuration option assumes that the SDK includes a hand-written client constructor defined in the client package.

## 0.27.0
**`(feat):`** Add support for SSE (Server-Sent Events) streaming responses. The user-facing interface for streaming responses remains the same between standard HTTP streaming and SSE.

## 0.26.0
**`(feat):`** Add support for sending custom Content-Type header values defined in the API.

## 0.25.0
**`(feat):`** Add support for sending extra body properties and query parameters via `RequestOption`.

## 0.24.0
**`(feat):`** Add support for reading headers from environment variables (e.g. `X-API-Version`).
