## 0.32.0
**`(feat):`** Add support for the `inlineFileProperties` configuration option, which generates file properties in the generated request type instead of as separate positional parameters.
```yaml # generators.yml
- name: fern-api/fern-go-sdk
  version: 0.32.0
  config:
    inlineFileProperties: true
```

**`(fix):`** Fixes an issue where the new `core.MultipartWriter` was generated for SDKs that didn't define any file upload endpoints.

**`(internal):`** Simplify the generated code from the new `core.MultipartWriter` introduced in 0.29.0 by refactoring `internal.WithMultipartContentType` as `internal.WithDefaultContentType`.

## 0.31.3
**`(fix):`** Updates the retrier to stop retrying on `409 Conflict` HTTP status codes by default.
