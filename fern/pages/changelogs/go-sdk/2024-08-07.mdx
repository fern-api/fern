## 0.23.0
**`(feat):`** Add support for always sending required properties.

### What's new
- Added the `alwaysSendRequiredProperties` configuration option. When `alwaysSendRequiredProperties` is enabled, required properties are never omitted in the type's wire representation. Any required property that is not explicitly set will send the default value for that type.
