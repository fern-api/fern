## 0.31.2
**`(internal):`** Add an `internal` package, which now contains the internal functionality previously included in the `core` package (e.g. `core.Caller` -> `internal.Caller`).
Although technically a breaking change in terms of the module itself, this change was always the intention, and should have zero impact on users.
Any `core` type that is meant for public consumption remains in the exported `core` package (e.g. `core.APIError` and `core.RequestOption`).
