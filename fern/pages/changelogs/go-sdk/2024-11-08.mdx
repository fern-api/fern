## 0.29.0
**`(feat):`** All SDKs now include an exported `FileParam` type that can be used to configure the `Content-Type` of file upload properties.

**`(fix):`** Resolves an issue where multipart/form-data lists were incorrectly serialized as JSON. They are now added as individual parts.

**`(internal):`** Refactor file upload endpoint generation with the new `core.MultipartWriter`. This significantly improves the aesthetics of the generated code.
