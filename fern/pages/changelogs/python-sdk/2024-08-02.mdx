## 3.4.0
**`(internal):`** Generator code now uses Pydantic V2, no changes to generated code.

### What's changed
- Internal: The SDK generator has now been upgraded to use Pydantic V2 internally. Note that there is no change to the generated code, however by leveraging Pydantic V2 you should notice an improvement in `fern generate` times.

## 3.3.4
**`(chore):`** Address a number of issues within generated unit tests.

### What's been fixed
- Generated tests that expect an empty result when they are of type `text` (not JSON) now appropriately expect an empty string instead of `None`.

### What's changed
- Improvement: Aliased literals are also defaulted within Pydantic models, whereas previously only direct literals were defaulted.
- Improvement: Snippets now provide optional literals in functions and models.

## 3.3.3
**`(fix):`** The generator now allows you to extend aliased types (as long as they're objects).

## 3.3.2
**`(fix):`** Regression in readme generation introduced in 3.3.1

## 3.3.1
**`(fix):`** Generated READMEs now reference RequestOptions as TypedDicts correctly.
