## 1.4.0-rc3
**`(fix):`** pin mypy dependency to 1.9.0 to prevent introducing upstream bugs

### What's been fixed
- Set `mypy` dev dependency in generated `pyproject.toml` to `1.9.0`. This prevents upstream `mypy` bugs from affecting user builds. Note that this is only a dev dependency, so it does not affect the behavior of the SDK.
- Temporarily disable unit test generation.

### What's changed
- Improvement: Use named parameters for all `httpx` request params.
