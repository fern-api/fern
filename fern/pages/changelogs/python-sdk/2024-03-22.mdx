## 0.12.5
**`(fix):`** the python SDK uses the timeout provided to the top level client as the default per-request

### What's been fixed
- the python SDK uses the timeout provided to the top level client as the default per-request, previously if there was no timeout override in the RequestOptions, we'd default to 60s, even if a timeout was provided at the client level.
