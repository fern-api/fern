## 1.1.0-rc0
**`(feat):`** The python SDK now includes a configuration option to skip pydantic validation.

### What's new
- [EXPERIMENTAL]: The python SDK now includes a configuration option to skip pydantic validation. This ensures that Pydantic does not immediately fail if the model being returned from an API does not exactly match the Pydantic model. This is meant to add flexibility, should your SDK fall behind your API, but should be used sparingly, as the type-hinting for users will still reflect the Pydantic model exactly.

## 1.0.1
**`(fix):`** Address Pydantic break when introducing `pydantic.v1` import within Pydantic V1

### What's been fixed
- Pydantic introduced a "break" to their 1.x libs by adding in a .v1 submodule that does not mirror the one that comes with pydantic v2. To get around this we now force the usage of the v1 submodule only if the pydantic version is v2.

## 0.13.4
**`(fix):`** revert changes introduced within 0.12.2

### What's been fixed
- revert the change from 0.13.2, the stream call returns a context manager, which is not awaited. The issue that this was meant to solve was actually fixed in version `0.12.2`.
