## 4.3.1
**`(feat):`** Requests for file download will now allow users to pass in a `chunk_size` option that allows them to receive chunks of a specific size
from the resultant `iter_bytes` invocation on the response byte stream.

Concretely, a user would leverage the following:
```python
client.download(
  ...,
  request_options={
    "chunk_size": 1024    # 1MB
  }
)
```
