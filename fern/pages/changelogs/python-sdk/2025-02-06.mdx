## 4.3.12
**`(feat):`** You can now override the default dev dependencies that fern generates out of the box using the `extra_dev_dependencies` configuration flag.
For example, to add a specific version of `mypy` as a dev dependency, you can now do the following:

```yaml
config:
  extra_dev_dependencies:
    mypy: "^1.11.0"
```

Additionally, if fern detects pre-existing mypy configuration in your `pyproject_toml` configuration, it will not add its default configuration for `mypy`.
