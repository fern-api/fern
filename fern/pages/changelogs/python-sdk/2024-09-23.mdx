## 4.2.7-rc1
**`(fix):`** When leveraging the `include_union_utils` configuration flag, the Pydantic models will no longer include transitive dependencies within
`update_forward_ref` calls, since these should not be necessary. This effectively scopes back the changes introduced in 4.0.0-rc5, which included
changes to improve circular reference handling in Pydantic models.


## 4.2.7-rc0
**`(fix):`** Dynamic header suppliers, as used within the OAuth provider are now invoked on every request, not just the first.
This was a regression introduced within an earlier version that is now fixed. As a results of this fix, the `refresh_token` is now correctly refreshed.
