## 4.2.0
**`(feat):`** Allow specifying arbitrary configuration to your packages `pyproject.toml` by adding a `pyproject_toml` block to your configuration
whatever you include in this block will be added as-is to the `pyproject.toml` file. The config, as an example is:

```yaml
config:
  pyproject_toml: |
    [tool.covcheck.group.unit.coverage]
    branch = 26.0
    line = 62.0

    [tool.covcheck.group.service.coverage]
    branch = 30.0
    line = 67.0
```


## 4.1.0
**`(feat):`** Allow specifying pip extras within your `pyproject.toml`. The following config:

```yaml
config:
  extra_dev_dependencies:
    covcheck:
      version: "^0.4.3"
      extras: ["toml"]
```

would add the following to your `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]
covcheck = { version = "^0.4.3", extras = ["toml"] }
```


## 4.0.0
**`(fix):`** Generated tests that expect an empty result when they are of type `text` (not JSON) now appropriately expect an empty string instead of `None` for async functions as well.
Version 3.3.4 fixed this for sync functions only, which was a bug.
