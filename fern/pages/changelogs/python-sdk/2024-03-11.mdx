## 0.12.0
**`(feat):`** Auto-generated unit and integration tests against a mock server.

### What's new
- Beta: The SDK now generates tests leveraging auto-generated data to test typing, as well as wire-formatting (e.g. the SDKs are sending and receiving data as expected). This comes out of the box within the generated github workflow, as well as through the fern cli: `fern test --command "your test command"`.
