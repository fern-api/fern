## 4.16.1
**`(internal):`** Fixes an internal release issue in `4.16.0`.


## 4.16.0
**`(feat):`** Add support for retrieving response headers from the generated `ApiError` class.


## 4.15.0
**`(feat):`** Add support for offset step pagination, where the offset position represents the element's index rather
than the page number.


**`(fix):`** Fixed an issue introduced in 4.14.0, where paginated endpoints were not returning the underlying data.

## 4.14.3
**`(fix):`** Add support for receiving raw responses from pagination endpoints.


## 4.14.2
**`(fix):`** Fix an issue where TypedDicts with circular references were not correctly serialized.
This issue only affected users that enabled `use_typeddict_requests`.


## 4.14.1
**`(fix):`** The generated GitHub workflow now uses `ubuntu-latest` instead of `ubuntu-20.04`


## 4.14.0
**`(feat):`** Add support for receiving raw responses from streaming endpoints.


**`(feat):`** Add support for excluding types from the generated `__init__.py` files.

```yaml
config:
  exclude_types_from_init_exports: true
```


## 4.13.0
**`(feat):`** Adds support for overriding literal global headers in the client constructor (e.g. `version`).

```python
client = Acme(
  ...
  version="1.0.0",
)
```


## 4.12.1
**`(fix):`** Fixes an issue where dictionary types defined within TypedDicts incorrectly used the
`typing_extensions.NotRequired` type.


**`(fix):`** Fixes an issue where optional `core.File` parameters would cause `mypy` failures.


**`(fix):`** Fixes a regression introduced in 4.12.0, where the non raw response client endpoints
did not respect the allowed method keywords (e.g. `list` was generated as `list_`).


## 4.12.0
**`(fix):`** Resolve issues with paginated endpoints generating incorrect endpoint return types.


## 4.11.0
**`(fix):`** Always represent nullable as Optional rather than NotRequired, only use
NotRequired for optional in typeddicts.


## 4.10.0
**`(feat):`** Add support for using TypedDicts for file upload request parameters. This flag should
be used in conjunction with the `use_typeddict_requests` flag like so:

```yaml
config:
  use_typeddict_requests: true
  use_typeddict_requests_for_file_upload: true
```


## 4.9.0
**`(feat):`** Implement raw client support for accessing response headers and data in unary endpoints.


## 4.8.0
**`(feat):`** Add support for inlining path parameters


## 4.7.0
**`(feat):`** Add support for user-agent header


## 4.6.0
**`(feat):`** Add support for generating legacy wire tests, and disable them by default. These tests will be restored and improved in the future.
Users can opt-in to generating legacy wire tests by setting the `include_legacy_wire_tests` flag to `true` in their configuration.

```yaml
config:
  include_legacy_wire_tests: true
```


## 4.5.0
**`(feat):`** Add support for websocket code generation. 


## 4.4.0
**`(feat):`** Add support for raw bytes responses.


## 4.3.21
**`(fix):`** Fix an issue where the default `timeout` was not being respected when a custom `httpx_client` was provided.


## 4.3.20
**`(fix):`** Update formatting across all generated files. There are no behavioral changes, but large diffs are expected.


## 4.3.19
**`(internal):`** Update the IR to v57.


## 4.3.18
**`(fix):`** Fix an issue where the `request_options` parameter name is now properly respected when it's 
renamed due to conflicts with other parameter names. Previously, the code would still reference the 
original parameter name internally, causing errors.


## 4.3.17
**`(fix):`** Fix an issue where parameter names that conflict with the `request_options` parameter are now properly deconflicted by 
prepending an underscore to the `request_options` parameter name.


## 4.3.16
**`(fix):`** Fix an issue where GeneratorExit was unintentionally being swallowed by code blocks within the HttpClient.stream() contextmanager.


## 4.3.15
**`(fix):`** Fix an issue where extraneous NameError-causing update_forward_refs invocations were being emitted.


## 4.3.14
**`(feat):`** Set the default number of retries to 2 (was 0) to align with the generated README.


## 4.3.13
**`(feat):`** The Python generator now supports conditioning dependencies on the Python version.


## 4.3.12
**`(feat):`** The Python generator now autogenerates a requirements.txt file.


## 4.3.11

## 4.3.10
**`(fix):`** Pagination correctly uses specified defaults to support custom schemes.


## 4.3.9
**`(fix):`** Fix indentation in generated README.md sections to ensure proper formatting and readability.


## 4.3.8
**`(fix):`** Include content-type headers when available as part of endpoint request generation.


## 4.3.7
**`(fix):`** Update multipart endpoint generation to propertly omit optional body parameters.


## 4.3.6
**`(fix):`** Fix README.md and reference.md generation.


## 4.3.5
**`(fix):`** Update README.md snippet builder to omit invalid snippets during readme config generation.


## 4.3.4
**`(fix):`** Update shared http_client.py to remove omitted entries during file upload requests.


## 4.3.3
**`(fix):`** The generator now writes the reference.md configuration correctly, using `.dict()` instead of `.json()`.


## 4.3.2
**`(fix):`** The generator will now correctly default to the configured global `default_bytes_stream_chunk_size` when the `request_options` parameter is not provided.


## 4.3.1
**`(feat):`** Requests for file download will now allow users to pass in a `chunk_size` option that allows them to receive chunks of a specific size
from the resultant `iter_bytes` invocation on the response byte stream.

Concretely, a user would leverage the following:
```python
client.download(
  ...,
  request_options={
    "chunk_size": 1024    # 1MB
  }
)
```


## 4.2.8
**`(fix):`** The snippet writer now correctly handles base64 strings.


## 4.2.7
**`(fix):`** The generated README will now have a section that links to the generated
SDK Reference (in `reference.md`).

```md
## Reference

A full reference for this library can be found [here](./reference.md).
```


## 4.2.7-rc4
**`(fix):`** Generated readmes now include the parameter name required for the request options parameter within the example snippets.

## 4.2.7-rc3
**`(fix):`** Now, when sending Snippet Templates back to Fern, the generator will not try to coerce a potentially missing ID into the `api_definition_id` field.
This, had been a cause of the error log `Failed to upload snippet templates to FDR, this is ok: one of the hex, bytes, bytes_le, fields, or int arguments must be given`.


## 4.2.7-rc2
**`(fix):`** Pydantic utilities now correctly handles cases where you have a Pydantic model, with a list of pydantic models as a field, where those models have literals.
Effectively, `deep_union_pydantic_objects` now handles lists of objects and merges them appropriately.


## 4.2.7-rc1
**`(fix):`** When leveraging the `include_union_utils` configuration flag, the Pydantic models will no longer include transitive dependencies within
`update_forward_ref` calls, since these should not be necessary. This effectively scopes back the changes introduced in 4.0.0-rc5, which included
changes to improve circular reference handling in Pydantic models.


## 4.2.7-rc0
**`(fix):`** Dynamic header suppliers, as used within the OAuth provider are now invoked on every request, not just the first.
This was a regression introduced within an earlier version that is now fixed. As a results of this fix, the `refresh_token` is now correctly refreshed.


## 4.2.6
**`(fix):`** Serialization utilities (necessary when pydantic aliases are removed) now respects dictionaries as well.


## 4.2.5
**`(fix):`** Parameters of file upload functions now default to OMIT, not None, so that the SDK appropriately
filters out unset parameters, while still allowing for user specified None values.


## 4.2.4
**`(fix):`** Datetime examples are generated correctly once again.
The `pydantic_utilities` file is python 3.8 compatible.


## 4.2.3
**`(fix):`** The content type of file properties is now respected for multipart
requests. For example, if you have a file property called `image` that has the
content type `image/jpeg`, then it will be sent as:

```python
"image": core.with_content_type(file=image, content_type="image/jpeg"),
````


## 4.2.2
**`(fix):`** The content type of non-file properties is now respected for multipart
requests. For example, if you have a type called `metadata` that has the
content type `application/json`, then it will be sent as:

```python
"metadata": (None, json.dumps(jsonable_encoder(metadata)), "application/json"),
```


## 4.2.1
**`(fix):`** When the generator runs bash commands such as `poetry install` and there is a failure,
now the `stderr` and `stdout` is logged to help improve user debugging.


## 4.2.0
**`(feat):`** Allow specifying arbitrary configuration to your packages `pyproject.toml` by adding a `pyproject_toml` block to your configuration
whatever you include in this block will be added as-is to the `pyproject.toml` file. The config, as an example is:

```yaml
config:
  pyproject_toml: |
    [tool.covcheck.group.unit.coverage]
    branch = 26.0
    line = 62.0

    [tool.covcheck.group.service.coverage]
    branch = 30.0
    line = 67.0
```


## 4.1.0
**`(feat):`** Allow specifying pip extras within your `pyproject.toml`. The following config:

```yaml
config:
  extra_dev_dependencies:
    covcheck:
      version: "^0.4.3"
      extras: ["toml"]
```

would add the following to your `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]
covcheck = { version = "^0.4.3", extras = ["toml"] }
```


## 4.0.0
**`(fix):`** Generated tests that expect an empty result when they are of type `text` (not JSON) now appropriately expect an empty string instead of `None` for async functions as well.
Version 3.3.4 fixed this for sync functions only, which was a bug.


## 4.0.0-rc9
**`(fix):`** All Pydantic V2 warnings have been resolved

### What's been fixed
- json_encoders have been removed from Pydantic V2, and replaced with a `model_serializer` method.
- additional model construction functions have been added when not leveraging pydantic field aliases to allow users to construct a model from JSOn without the need for dealiasing the object themselves.

## 4.0.0-rc8
**`(fix):`** Pydantic models that call `update_forward_refs` on non-union circular reference dependencies now pass in `localns` for
the current member, a field in Pydantic V1 that provides object contexts to models in the event objects are not fully rebuilt.


## 4.0.0-rc7
**`(fix):`** The generator now respects the old use_str_enums flag again, a regression was introduced where only the new flag `enum_type`
was respected.


## 4.0.0-rc6
**`(fix):`** Pydantic models now call update forward refs on non-union circular references. This
prevents runtime errors in certain cases where types self reference itself through
a union.


## 4.0.0-rc5
**`(fix):`** Pydantic models now call update forward refs on non-union circular references. This
prevents runtime errors in certain cases where types self reference itself through
a union.


## 4.0.0-rc4
**`(fix):`** Pydantic models now call update forward refs on non-union circular references. This
prevents runtime errors in certain cases where types self reference itself through
a union.


## 4.0.0-rc3
**`(fix):`** Pydantic models now call update forward refs on non-union circular references. This
prevents runtime errors in certain cases where types self reference itself through
a union.


## 4.0.0-rc2
**`(fix):`** Update .dict calls in Pydantic V2 to be back to pre-3.10.4 logic for SDKs that continue using Pydantic aliases.

## 4.0.0-rc1
**`(fix):`** Update .dict calls in Pydantic V2 to be back to pre-3.10.4 logic.

### What's been fixed
- Pydantic V2 `.dict` calls are updated to be back to pre-3.10.4 logic. This is fix a regression where nested literals were being omitted due to the Pydantic V2 serializers not respecting the recursive .dict logic, as Pydantic V2 shells out `model_dump` calls to Rust library and serializers, as opposed to recursively calling `model_dump`.
It is expected that performance will not be degraded given the Rust-based serializers have optimized performance, compared to the Pydantic V1 .dict approach.

## 4.0.0-rc0
**`(fix):`** Rerelease 3.11.0-rc0 as a major version, with a configuration flag to disable the behavior (`use_pydantic_field_aliases`), defaulted to `true` to preserve existing behavior.

**`(internal):`** The generator now shares "as is" files with Pydantic and FastAPI generators.

### What's been fixed
- Rerelease 3.11.0-rc0 as a major version, with a configuration flag to disable the behavior (`use_pydantic_field_aliases`), defaulted to `false` to introduce the break on a major version.
To maintain parity with pre-3.11.0 behavior, update the flag to `true`:

  ```yaml
  - name: fernapi/fern-python-sdk
    version: 4.0.0-rc0
    config:
      pydantic_config:
        use_pydantic_field_aliases: true
  ```

## 3.11.0-rc0
**`(chore):`** Remove Pydantic field aliases and leverage an internal representation.

### What's been fixed
- Pydantic field aliases are removed and replaced with an internal representation. This allows for more robust handling of field aliases and prevents issues with Pydantic V2 and mypy.
Previously, you'd have for V1 and V2 compatibility in Pydantic, you'd want to conditionally apply the config class within the base model, however this would lead to mypy errors when filling out a model with it's field alias. To solve this, We used the deprecated `class Config`, regardless of the Pydantic version to satisfy mypy, which lead to warnings in the console.
Now, we've removed the field aliases and replaced them with an internal representation, which allows us to avoid pydantic config altogether.

## 3.10.8
**`(fix):`** Allow for fields prefixed with the name `model`, a silent break introduced in Pydantic V2.

## 3.10.7
**`(fix):`** When not leveraging mock integration tests, still run pytest over everything, not a specific directory.
