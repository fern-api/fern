## 4.0.0-rc0
**`(fix):`** Rerelease 3.11.0-rc0 as a major version, with a configuration flag to disable the behavior (`use_pydantic_field_aliases`), defaulted to `true` to preserve existing behavior.

**`(internal):`** The generator now shares "as is" files with Pydantic and FastAPI generators.

### What's been fixed
- Rerelease 3.11.0-rc0 as a major version, with a configuration flag to disable the behavior (`use_pydantic_field_aliases`), defaulted to `false` to introduce the break on a major version.
To maintain parity with pre-3.11.0 behavior, update the flag to `true`:

  ```yaml
  - name: fernapi/fern-python-sdk
    version: 4.0.0-rc0
    config:
      pydantic_config:
        use_pydantic_field_aliases: true
  ```
