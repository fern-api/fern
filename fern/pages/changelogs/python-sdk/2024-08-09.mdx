## 3.10.0
**`(feat):`** Introduce forward compatible Python enums

### What's new
- Adds a new flag to generate forward compatible Python enums, as opposed to leveraging raw string enums as literals. This works through addding an "_UNKNOWN" member to your enum set, the value of which is the raw value of the unrecognized enum.

## 3.9.0
**`(feat):`** Introduce Pythonic naming for discriminated union members through `union_naming` configuration flag.

### What's new
- A new configuration is introduced to make discriminated union member naming more Pythonic. With V1 union naming, member names change from `<UnionName>_<DiscriminantValue>` to `<DiscriminantValue><UnionName>`. Concretely, union members previously named `Chat_User` will now be named `UserChat` under the new configuration.

## 3.8.0
**`(chore):`** Generated SDKs now use ruff for linting and formatting instead of Black.
