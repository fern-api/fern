## 4.0.0-rc8
**`(fix):`** Pydantic models that call `update_forward_refs` on non-union circular reference dependencies now pass in `localns` for
the current member, a field in Pydantic V1 that provides object contexts to models in the event objects are not fully rebuilt.


## 4.0.0-rc7
**`(fix):`** The generator now respects the old use_str_enums flag again, a regression was introduced where only the new flag `enum_type`
was respected.
