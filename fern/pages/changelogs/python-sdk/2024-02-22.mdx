## 0.11.3
**`(fix):`** Transition from lists to sequences within function calls

### What's been fixed
- Transition from lists to sequences within function calls, this is a fix as a result of how mypy handles type variance. This fix is only for function calls as testing shows that we do not hit the same issue within mypy with list[union[*]] fields on pydantic objects.

### What's changed
- Improvement: The Python SDK generator now defaults to `require_optional_fields = False`. This means that any requests that have optional fields no longer require a user to input data (or a `None` value) in.
