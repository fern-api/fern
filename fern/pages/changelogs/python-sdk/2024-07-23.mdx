## 3.0.0-rc1
**`(fix):`** `expected_types` within our test suite are now typed as `Tuple[typing.Any, typing.Any]`.

### What's been fixed
- Sometimes mypy will error on the typing of `expected_types` within our test suite, despite them being labeled as `typing.Any`. This updates the types for tuples to `typing.Tuple[tying.Any, typing.Any]` to appease mypy.

## 3.0.0-rc0
**`(break):`** The generated models now support Pydantic V2 outright, it no longer uses `pydantic.v1` models.

### What's changed
- The generated models now support Pydantic V2 outright, it no longer uses `pydantic.v1` models.
- Public fields previously prefixed with `_` are now prefixed with `f_` (Pydantic V2 does not allow for `_` prefixes on public fields and Python does not allow for a numeric prefix)

### What's been removed
- wrapped aliases outside of Pydantic V1
- custom root validators outside of Pydantic V1
