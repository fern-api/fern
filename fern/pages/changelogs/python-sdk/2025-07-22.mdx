## 4.16.0
**`(feat):`** Add support for retrieving response headers from the generated `ApiError` class.

than the page number.


**`(fix):`** Fixed an issue introduced in 4.14.0, where paginated endpoints were not returning the underlying data.


## 4.14.6
**`(fix):`** Fixed an issue where multipart/form-data content types are now explicitly sent when configured in the API definition.


## 4.14.5
**`(fix):`** Fixed an issue introduced in 4.14.0, where SSE streaming responses were not yielded correctly.


## 4.14.4
**`(fix):`** Fixed an issue where filename and plain text content-type parameters were being incorrectly serialized.


## 4.14.3
**`(fix):`** Add support for receiving raw responses from pagination endpoints.


## 4.14.2
**`(fix):`** Fix an issue where TypedDicts with circular references were not correctly serialized.
This issue only affected users that enabled `use_typeddict_requests`.


## 4.14.1
**`(fix):`** The generated GitHub workflow now uses `ubuntu-latest` instead of `ubuntu-20.04`


## 4.14.0
**`(feat):`** Add support for receiving raw responses from streaming endpoints.


**`(feat):`** Add support for excluding types from the generated `__init__.py` files.

```yaml
config:
  exclude_types_from_init_exports: true
```


## 4.13.0
**`(feat):`** Adds support for overriding literal global headers in the client constructor (e.g. `version`).

```python
client = Acme(
  ...
  version="1.0.0",
)
```


## 4.12.1
**`(fix):`** Fixes an issue where dictionary types defined within TypedDicts incorrectly used the
`typing_extensions.NotRequired` type.


**`(fix):`** Fixes an issue where optional `core.File` parameters would cause `mypy` failures.


**`(fix):`** Fixes a regression introduced in 4.12.0, where the non raw response client endpoints
did not respect the allowed method keywords (e.g. `list` was generated as `list_`).


## 4.12.0
**`(fix):`** Resolve issues with paginated endpoints generating incorrect endpoint return types.


## 4.11.0
**`(fix):`** Always represent nullable as Optional rather than NotRequired, only use
NotRequired for optional in typeddicts.


## 4.10.0
**`(feat):`** Add support for using TypedDicts for file upload request parameters. This flag should
be used in conjunction with the `use_typeddict_requests` flag like so:

```yaml
config:
  use_typeddict_requests: true
  use_typeddict_requests_for_file_upload: true
```


## 4.9.0
**`(feat):`** Implement raw client support for accessing response headers and data in unary endpoints.


## 4.8.0
**`(feat):`** Add support for inlining path parameters


## 4.7.0
