## 4.2.7-rc4
**`(fix):`** Generated readmes now include the parameter name required for the request options parameter within the example snippets.

## 4.2.7-rc3
**`(fix):`** Now, when sending Snippet Templates back to Fern, the generator will not try to coerce a potentially missing ID into the `api_definition_id` field.
This, had been a cause of the error log `Failed to upload snippet templates to FDR, this is ok: one of the hex, bytes, bytes_le, fields, or int arguments must be given`.


## 4.2.7-rc2
**`(fix):`** Pydantic utilities now correctly handles cases where you have a Pydantic model, with a list of pydantic models as a field, where those models have literals.
Effectively, `deep_union_pydantic_objects` now handles lists of objects and merges them appropriately.
