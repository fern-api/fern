## 3.1.0-rc0
**`(chore):`** The root client is now exported from the main `__init__.py`.

### What's changed
- Improvement: The root client users interact with is now exported from the main `__init__.py`, this allows users to access the client via `from my_sdk import my_sdk_client` as opposed to `from my_sdk.client import my_sdk_client`.

### What's been removed
- Note this comes with an edge-case break. In the unlikely event you have a type that conflicts in naming with the exported root client, that type model is post-fixed with "Model". e.g. a type `Merge` in an SDK exporting a client `Merge` becomes `MergeModel`.

## 3.0.0-rc2
**`(fix):`** `update_forward_refs` no longer raises errors, preserving original behavior, pre-3.x.
