## 4.2.2
**`(fix):`** The content type of non-file properties is now respected for multipart
requests. For example, if you have a type called `metadata` that has the
content type `application/json`, then it will be sent as:

```python
"metadata": (None, json.dumps(jsonable_encoder(metadata)), "application/json"),
```
