## 4.2.3
**`(fix):`** The content type of file properties is now respected for multipart
requests. For example, if you have a file property called `image` that has the
content type `image/jpeg`, then it will be sent as:

```python
"image": core.with_content_type(file=image, content_type="image/jpeg"),
````


## 4.2.2
**`(fix):`** The content type of non-file properties is now respected for multipart
requests. For example, if you have a type called `metadata` that has the
content type `application/json`, then it will be sent as:

```python
"metadata": (None, json.dumps(jsonable_encoder(metadata)), "application/json"),
```
