## 4.6.0
**`(feat):`** Add support for generating legacy wire tests, and disable them by default. These tests will be restored and improved in the future.
Users can opt-in to generating legacy wire tests by setting the `include_legacy_wire_tests` flag to `true` in their configuration.

```yaml
config:
  include_legacy_wire_tests: true
```
