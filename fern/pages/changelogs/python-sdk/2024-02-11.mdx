## 0.9.1
**`(fix):`** Remove literals from SDK function signatures, as they are not modifiable for end users

### What's been fixed
- Remove literals from SDK function signatures, as they are not modifiable for end users.
- Acknowledge the optionality of a `File` property, previously we were requiring all `File` type inputs, even if they were specified as optional within the OpenAPI or Fern definition. Now, we check if the parameter is required and make the parameter optional if it is not.

## 0.9.0
**`(feat):`** The SDK generator now supports whitelabelling

### What's new
- The SDK generator now supports whitelabelling. When this is turned on, there will be no mention of Fern in the generated code.
