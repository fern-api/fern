`fern upgrade` will upgrade your compiler version in `fern.config.json` to the
latest version. It will also upgrade generators in `generators.yml` to their minimum-compatible versions.

## Usage

```bash
$ fern upgrade
```

## Release candidates

By adding `--rc`, you can upgrade to the compiler's latest release candidate. Using a release candidate is not recommended for production use.

```bash
$ fern upgrade --rc
```
