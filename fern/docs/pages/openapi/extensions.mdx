title: Fern | Fern's custom OpenAPI extensions for higher-quality SDKs
description: Learn about Fern's OpenAPI extensions for SDK method names, authentication overrides, global headers, enum descriptions and names, audiences, and more.
---

Fern supports different OpenAPI extensions so that you can generate higher-quality SDKs.

## SDK method names

By default, Fern uses the `tag` and `operationId` fields to generate the SDK method. So an endpoint with a
tag `users` and operationId `users_create` will generate an SDK that reads `client.users.create()`.

To explicitly set the SDK method you can leverage the extensions:

- `x-fern-sdk-group-name` which groups SDK methods together
- `x-fern-sdk-method-name` which is used as the method name in the SDK

The OpenAPI below will `client.users.create()`:

```yaml openapi.yaml
paths:
  /users:
    post:
      x-fern-sdk-group-name: users
      x-fern-sdk-method-name: create
```

If you omit the `x-fern-sdk-group-name` extension, then the generated SDK method will live at the root.
For example, the following OpenAPI will generate `client.create_user()`:

```yaml openapi.yaml
paths:
  /users:
    post:
      x-fern-sdk-method-name: create_user
```

## Authentication overrides

For authentication within your SDK, you may want to customize the:
- Names of the parameters a user will populate to provide their credentials
- Any environment variable the SDK can scan for to automatically provide the user's credentials automatically

By default, Fern uses selects names for authentication parameters like api_key, username and password, etc.
Note that this configuration is optional, and even when provided `name` or `env` may be provided alone, both are not required.

For bearer authentication:

```yaml openapi.yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    BearerAuth:
      type: http
      scheme: bearer
      x-fern-bearer:
        name: apiKey
        env: FERN_API_KEY
```

In a Python SDK for example, the above configuration would produce a client that looks like:

```python
import os

class Client:

  def __init__(self, *, apiKey: str = os.getenv("FERN_API_KEY"))
```

Similarly, for basic authentication the configuration is:

```yaml openapi.yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    BasicAuth:
      type: http
      scheme: basic
      x-fern-basic:
        username:
          name: clientId
          env: MY_CLIENT_ID
        password:
          name: clientSecret
          env: MY_CLIENT_SECRET
```

And for a custom auth header configuration:

```yaml openapi.yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    ApiKeyAuth:
      type: apiKey
      in: header
      name: X-API-Key
      x-fern-header:
        name: header
        env: MY_HEADER_ENVVAR
```

## Global headers
At times, your API will leverage certain headers for every endpoint, or the majority of them, we call these "global headers". For convenience, generated Fern SDKs
expose "global headers" to easily be updated on API calls. Take for example an API key, if we declare the API key as a global header, a user will be able to 
plug theirs in easily:
```python
import os

class Client:

  def __init__(self, *, apiKey: str)
```

To configure global headers, Fern will automatically pull out headers that are used in every request, or the majority of requests and mark them as global.
In order to label additional headers as global, or to alias the names of global headers, you can leverage the `x-fern-global-headers` extension:

```yaml
x-fern-global-headers:
  - header: custom_api_key
    name: api_key
  - header: userpool_id
    optional: true
```

yields the following client:

```python
import os

class Client:

  def __init__(self, *, apiKey: str, userpoolId: typing.Optional[str])
```

## Enum descriptions and names

OpenAPI doesn't natively support adding descriptions to enum values. To do this in Fern you can use the `x-fern-enum`
extension.

In the example below, we've added some descriptions to enum values. These descriptions will
propagate into the generated SDK and docs website.

```yaml openapi.yml
components:
  schemas:
    CardSuit:
      enum:
        - clubs
        - diamonds
        - hearts
        - spades
      x-fern-enum: # <----
        clubs:
          description: Some docs about clubs
        spades:
          description: Some docs about spades
```

`x-fern-enum` also supports a `name` field that allows you to customize the name of the enum in code.
This is particularly useful when you have enums that rely on symbolic characters that would otherwise cause
generated code not to compile.

For example, the following OpenAPI

```yaml openapi.yml
components:
  schemas:
    Operand:
      enum:
        - >
        - <
      x-fern-enum:
        >:
          name: GreaterThan
          description: Checks if value is greater than
        <:
          name: LessThan
          description: Checks if value is less than
```

would generate

```typescript operand.ts
export enum Operand {
  GreaterThan = ">",
  LessThan = "<",
}
```

## Schema names

OpenAPI allows you to define inlined schemas that do not have names.

```yaml openapi.yml
components:
  schemas:
    Movie:
      type: object
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        cast:
          type: array
          items:
            type: object # <---- Inline Type
            properties:
              firstName:
                type: string
              lastName:
                type: string
              age:
                type: integer
```

Fern automatically generates names for all the inlined schemas. For example, in this example,
Fern would generate the name `CastItem` for the inlined array item schema.

```typescript
export interface Movie {
    name?: string;
    cast?: CastItem[]
}

export interface CastItem  { # <----- Auto-generated name
    firstName?: string;
    lastName?: string;
    age?: integer;
}
```

If you want to override the generated name, you can use the extension `x-fern-type-name`.

```yaml openapi.yml
components:
  schemas:
    Movie:
      type: object
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        cast:
          type: array
          items:
            type: object
            x-fern-type-name: Person # <----
            properties:
              firstName:
                type: string
              lastName:
                type: string
              age:
                type: integer
```

This would replace `CastItem` with `Person` and the generated code would read more idiomatically:

```typescript
export interface Movie {
    name?: string;
    cast?: Person[]
}

export interface Person  { # <---- Overridden name
    firstName?: string;
    lastName?: string;
    age?: integer;
}
```

## Parameter Names 

The `x-fern-parameter-name` extension allows you to customize the variable name of OpenAPI 
parameters. 

For example, if you have a header `X-API-Version`, you may want the parameter 
in code to be called `version`. 

<CodeBlock title="openapi.yml">
```yaml
paths:
  "/user":
    get:
      operationId: get_user
      parameters:
        - in: header
          name: X-API-Version
          x-fern-parameter-name: version # <---- specify the parameter name
          schema:
            type: string
          required: true
      ...
```
</CodeBlock>

## Server names

The `x-fern-server-name` extension is used to name your servers. 

<CodeBlock title="openapi.yml">
```yaml
servers:
- url: https://api.example.com
  x-fern-server-name: Production
- url: https://sandbox.example.com
  x-fern-server-name: Sandbox
```
</CodeBlock>

In a generated TypeScript SDK, you'd see:

<CodeBlock title="environment.ts">
```yaml
export const ExampleEnvironment = {
    Production: "https://api.example.com",
} as const;

export type ExampleEnvironment = typeof ExampleEnvironment.Production;
```
</CodeBlock>

## Audiences

The `x-fern-audiences` extension is used to mark endpoints with a particular audience
so that you can filter your SDKs and Docs as you would like in Fern.  

In the example below, we have marked the `POST /users` endpoint with the `public` audience. 

<CodeBlock title="openapi.yml">
```yaml
paths: 
  /users: 
    post: 
      x-fern-audiences: # <---- mark with the public audience
        - public
      operationId: users_create
      ...
  /projects: 
    post: 
      operationId: projects_create
      ...
```
</CodeBlock>

### Audiences with SDKs

To filter to the public audience when generating code, update your `generators.yml` configuration to include:

<CodeBlock title="generators.yml">
```yaml
groups: 
  sdks: 
    audiences: # <---- the generators will now be filtered to the public audience
      - public 
    generators: 
      - name: fernapi/fern-tyepscript-node-sdk
        version: 0.8.8
        ...
```
</CodeBlock>

### Audiences with Docs

If generating Fern Docs, you'll need to update your `docs.yml` configuration to include:

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
navigation:
  - api: API Reference
    audiences: # <---- the API Reference will now be filtered to the public audience
      - public
```
</CodeBlock>

## Streaming

The `x-fern-streaming` extension is used to specify that an endpoint's response is streamed.
Simply include the `x-fern-streaming` extension within your endpoint like so:

```yaml openapi.yml
paths:
  /logs:
    post:
      x-fern-streaming: true
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                topic:
                  description: ""
                  type: string
      responses:
        "200":
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: "#/components/schemas/Log"
components:
  schemas:
    Log:
      type: object
      properties:
        topic:
          type: string
        message:
          type: string
```

If you want to generate both a non-streaming and streaming SDK method variant for the same endpoint,
you can use the extended `x-fern-streaming` syntax:

```yaml openapi.yml
paths:
  /logs:
    post:
      x-fern-streaming:
        stream-condition: $request.stream
        response:
          $ref: "#/components/schemas/Logs"
        response-stream:
          $ref: "#/components/schemas/Log"
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                topic:
                  description: ""
                  type: string
      responses:
        "200":
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: "#/components/schemas/Log"
components:
  schemas:
    Log:
      type: object
      properties:
        topic:
          type: string
        message:
          type: string
    Logs:
      type: array
      items:
        - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Log"
```

The same endpoint path (`/logs` in the example above) is used for both of the generated SDK methods,
and the `stream-condition` setting includes a property in the request body that is used to
distinguish whether the response should be streamed.

In the example above, a property named `stream` is sent as `true` for the streaming variant,
and sent as `false` for the non-streaming variant. Additionally, a stream of the `Log` type
is returned in the streaming variant, whereas the `Logs` array is returned in the non-streaming
variant.

## Ignoring Schemas or endpoints

If you want Fern to skip reading any endpoint or schemas, you can use the 
`x-fern-ignore` extension. 

To skip an endpoint, you must add `x-fern-ignore: true` at the operation 
level. 

```yaml openapi.yml 
paths:
  /users: 
    get: 
      x-fern-ignore: true # <-----------
      ...
```

To skip a schema, you msut add `x-fern-ignore: true` at the schema level. 

```yaml openapi.yml 
components: 
  schemas: 
    SchemaToSkip: 
      x-fern-ignore: true # <-----------
      ...
```

## Overlaying extensions 

Because of the number of tools that use OpenAPI, it may be more convenient to 
"overlay" your fern specific OpenAPI extensions onto your original definition. \
In order to do this you can use the `x-fern-overrides-filepath` extension.

Below is an example of how someone can overlay the extensions `x-fern-sdk-method-name` and 
`x-fern-sdk-group-name` without polluting their original OpenAPI. The combined result is 
shown in the third tab. 

<CodeBlocks>
    <CodeBlock title="openapi.yml">
    ```yaml
    openapi: 3.0.0
    info:
      title: User API
      version: 1.0.0
    x-fern-overrides-filepath: overrides.yml # <--------- 
    paths:
      /users:
        get:
          summary: Get a list of users
          description: Retrieve a list of users from the system.
          responses:
            '200':
              description: Successful response
            '500':
              description: Internal Server Error
    ```
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock title="overrides.yml">
    ```yaml
    paths:
      /users:
        get:
          x-fern-sdk-group-name: users
          x-fern-sdk-method-name: get
    ```
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock title="Overlayed OpenAPI">
    ```yaml
    paths:
      /users:
        get:
          x-fern-sdk-group-name: users # <---------------
          x-fern-sdk-method-name: get  # <---------------
          summary: Get a list of users
          description: Retrieve a list of users from the system.
          responses:
            '200':
              description: Successful response
            '500':
              description: Internal Server Error
    ```
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeBlocks>

## Request + Response Examples

While OpenAPI has several fields for examples, there is no easy way 
to associate a request with a response. This is expecially useful when 
you want to show more than one example in your documentation. 

`x-fern-examples` is an array of examples. Each element of the array 
can contain `path-parameters`, `query-parameters`, `request` and `response`
examples values that are all associated. 
```yaml openapi.yml 
paths: 
  /users/{userId}: 
    get:
      x-fern-examples:
        - path-parameters: # <----- Example 1
            userId: user-1234
          response: 
            body: 
              name: Foo
              ssn: 1234
        - path-parameters: # <----- Example 2
            userId: user-4567
          response: 
            body: 
              name: Foo
              ssn: 4567
components: 
  schemas: 
    User: 
      type: object
      properties: 
        name: 
          type: string
        ssn: 
          type: integer
```

### Code Samples

If you'd like to specify custom code samples for your example, 
use `code-samples`. 

```yaml openapi.yml 
paths: 
  /users/{userId}: 
    get:
      x-fern-examples:
        - path-parameters: 
            userId: user-1234
          response: 
            body: 
              name: Foo
              ssn: 1234
          code-samples: # <----------- Add your code samples here
            sdk: typescript
            code: | 
              import { UserClient } from "..."; 

              client.users.get("user-1234")
```

If you're on the Fern Starter plan for SDKs you won't 
have to worry about manually adding code samples! Our generators will do that for you. 

If there's an extension you want that doesn't already exist, file an [issue](https://github.com/fern-api/fern/issues/new) to start a discussion about it.
