To use an OpenAPI spec, you can pass in the filepath or URL. 

To pass in an OpenAPI spec from a filepath:

```bash
npm install -g fern-api
fern init --openapi <filepath to openapi>
```

Alternatively, to point to the URL of an OpenAPI spec:

```bash
npm install -g fern-api
fern init --openapi <url to openapi>

```

Fern will generate the following directory with your OpenAPI spec inside of it.

```bash
fern/
├─ fern.config.json
└─ api/
  ├─ generators.yml
  └─ openapi/
    └─ openapi.json # <--- your openapi file
```

Run `fern check` to validate the OpenAPI spec. Resolve any errors. 
Having trouble? Reach out in the [Fern Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/JkkXumPzcG). 

If you're having trouble understanding the errors, run the command `fern write-definition`.
This command will convert your OpenAPI spec into a Fern Definition.

If there are no errors, you can run [fern generate](/overview/cli/fern-generate).
