Using examples in OpenAPI shows API consumers what requests and responses look like. They can be provided for request bodies, response bodies, and individual parameters.

## How to Use Examples 

1. Inline examples

Examples can be placed directly within the operation definition under `paths`. Here's an example:

```yaml
paths:
  /movies:
    post:
      summary: Create a new movie
      requestBody:
        required: true
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/Movie'
            examples:
              movieExample:
                summary: This is an example of a movie
                value:
                  name: Schindler's List
                  rating: 5.0
                  id: tt0108052
```

2. Reusable examples

For more general examples that apply to multiple parts of the API, you can define them under the `components/examples` section. These can be referenced elsewhere in the documentation.

```yaml
components:
  examples:
    MovieExample:
      summary: Example of a movie object
      value:
        name: Shawshank Redemption
        rating: 5.0
        id: tt0111161

paths:
  /movies/{movieId}:
    get:
      summary: Get movie by ID
      parameters:
        - name: movieId
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
      responses:
        '200':
          description: A movie object
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Movie'
              examples:
                MovieExample:
                  $ref: '#/components/examples/MovieExample'
```

## How Examples are used in Fern SDKs

Fern SDKs use examples from your OpenAPI document to generate comments that show up in your IDE. For example, in a Node.js SDK:

```ts
/**
 * @example
 *     {
 *         title: "Shawshank Redemption",
 *         rating: "5.0",
 *         id: "tt0111161"
 *     }
 */
```

Here's an [example in GitHub](https://github.com/FlatFilers/flatfile-node/blob/ab955a0a337c40ea00755e24df08f8c9a146c39c/src/api/resources/documents/types/DocumentResponse.ts#L8-L27) from Flatfile's Node.js SDK. 

## How Examples are used in Fern Docs 

In the request and response code snippets, you'll see the example values used.

If you generate SDKs with Fern, the code examples for each language will also be populated with the example values. [Check out Flatfile's Docs to see this in action](https://reference.flatfile.com/api-reference/documents/create-a-document).
