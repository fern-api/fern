In this quickstart, we'll install Fern, initialize a sample API, and generate a TypeScript Node.js SDK. The output files will be downloaded to your local file system.

We'll use a [**Fern Definition**](/api-definition/fern-definition/overview) to describe our endpoints, types, and errors. Alternatively, you can use an [OpenAPI specification](/api-definition/openapi/import).

### Pre-requisities 

- Node.js 18 or higher

### Step 1: Install Fern

```bash
npm install -g fern-api
```

### Step 2: Initialize Fern 

```bash
fern init
```

This will create a `fern/` directory which contains a sample API and configuration. This generally lives in your backend repo, but you can also have an independent repo dedicated to your API (like [Seam's](https://github.com/seamapi/fern-config)).

<CodeBlock title = "fern/">
```yml
├─ fern.config.json
├─ generators.yml # generators you're using
└─ definition/
  ├─ api.yml  
  └─ imdb.yml # endpoints, types, and errors
```
</CodeBlock>

The example API we'll use is inspired by IMDb (International Movie Database). We'll see an endpoint for creating and retrieving a `Movie`.

<CodeBlock title="imdb.yml">
```yml
service:
  auth: false
  base-path: /movies
  endpoints:
    create: 
      method: POST
      path: /
      request: CreateMovieRequest
      response: MovieId
    get:
      method: GET
      path: /{id}
      path-parameters:
        id: MovieId
      response: Movie
      errors:
        - DoesNotExistError

types:
  MovieId: uuid 

  CreateMovieRequest:
    properties:
      title: string

  Movie:
    properties:
      id: MovieId
      title: string
      rating:
        type: double
        docs: The rating scale is one to five stars

errors:
  DoesNotExistError:
    status-code: 404
    type: MovieId
```
</CodeBlock>

### Step 3: Generate code

By default, `generators.yml` contains the TypeScript Node.js generator.

<CodeBlock title = "generators.yml">
```diff
default-group: local
groups:
  local:
    generators:
      - name: fernapi/fern-typscript-node-sdk
          version: 0.8.8
          output:
            location: local-file-system
            path: ../generated/sdks/node
```
</CodeBlock>

To invoke the generator, run:

```bash
fern generate
```

By default, Fern runs the generator in the cloud and compiles your API definition into files. Once complete, you'll see new files in `/generated/sdks/node`.

### What's next

Congratulations! You installed Fern, initialized a sample API, and generated your first SDK. 

As a next step, you can:
- Use an [OpenAPI Specification](/openapi/import)
- Define your API as a [Fern Definition](/fern-definition/definition)
- Configure additional code [generators](/generators)
- Publish the Node.js SDK to [npm & GitHub](/sdks/node-sdk#publish-a-public-package) *paid feature*
