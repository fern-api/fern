Amazon built [Smithy](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy). Palantir built
[Conjure](https://github.com/palantir/conjure). Google built [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc). Facebook built [GraphQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec) and [Thrift](https://github.com/facebook/fbthrift). 

These inventions all share a common design: **schema-first automation for API
development.** This saves developer time and increases product
velocity.

We built Fern to productize this design and make it accessible to all
software companies.

## Schema-first API design

Fern embraces schema-first API design: **You first define your API in Fern.**
After that, you implement your API and generate helpful outputs, like SDKs or API documentation.

With schema-first API design, you unlock a few benefits:

1. **Best practices built-in.** Our compiler will warn you against common
   anti-patterns and pitfalls.
2. **A single source of truth.** No more keeping your OpenAPI spec up-to-date
   with your backend. Out-of-date documentation is a problem of the past.
3. **A simple format encourages collaboration**. An easy-to-write format means
   that backend and frontend devs can collaborate on API design. If you have
   multiple dev teams, a standardized format makes it easy for teams to learn
   about and consume each other's APIs.

## Product velocity

  "Building 2 new APIs this last 1.5 weeks with Fern was awesome - I bet it sped
  up new API development by at least 50%.  The bits that were sped up was the
  most tedious, annoying bits too. Very thankful to be using Fern right now!"

The Fern compiler handles the tedious and time-consuming developer work
that goes into building a new API. **This frees up developer time to build your
product faster.**

On the server-side, Fern generates the types and networking logic for you. Just
implement the business logic, and you're good to go.

When consuming your new API, Fern's auto-generated SDKs are a dream.
You get client libraries to use in tests, your frontend,
and other microservices. They let you build faster.

- **Think in terms of operations, not HTTP.** Endpoint calls are just function
  calls. No need to hardcode HTTP paths or append query parameters.
- **Type safety** to ensure you're using the API correctly. If you're not, you'll get compile errors.
- **Auto-completion in code editors** instead of reading backend code to understand the API.

And unlike most auto-generated SDKs, ours are idiomatic and feel handwritten.
You'll be excited to show them off to your customers.
