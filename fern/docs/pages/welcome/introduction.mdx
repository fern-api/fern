Fern is an [open source](https://github.com/fern-api/fern) toolkit for building
REST APIs. With Fern, you can generate SDKs, API documentation,
and boilerplate for your backend server.

Fern is **fully compatible with OpenAPI**. Leverage your existing OpenAPI
specification to generate code and documentation through Fern. If you're not a fan of
OpenAPI, you can also use Fern's simpler format to define your API.

## Fern's Magic 🪄

The magic of Fern is our compiler, which transforms your API definition into:

- **SDKs.** Client libraries that **feel handwritten** and are published to package managers like npm and PyPI.
- **Documentation.** A beautiful docs website with a best-in-class API Reference. Automatically sync your Postman Collection
- **Backend boilerplate.** Server side code, such as Pydantic models for FastAPI and Jersey interfaces for Spring Boot. Get compile-time validation that your endpoints are being served correctly.
