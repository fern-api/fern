[A starter repo for Spring, using Fern](https://github.com/fern-api/spring-starter/)

The Spring generator generates types and networking logic for your Spring server. This saves you time and add compile-time safety that you are serving the exact API that you specified in your API Definition.

Available on the open source plan.

## What Fern generates

- Java classes for your API types
- Exceptions that you can throw for non-200 responses
- Abstract classes for you to define your business logic
- All the networking/HTTP logic to call your API
