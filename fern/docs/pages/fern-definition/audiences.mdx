Audiences are a useful tool for segmenting your API for different consumers. Common audiences include:

- Internal consumers (e.g., frontend developers who use the API)
- Beta testers
- Customers

Fern has a first-class concept for marking different endpoints, types, and properties for different audiences.

## Configuration

To prevent typos, you must specify all your audiences in `api.yml`:

<CodeBlock title="api.yml">```yaml name: api audiences: - internal - beta ```</CodeBlock>

In `generators.yml`, you can apply audience filters so that only certain
endpoints are passed to the generators:

<CodeBlock title = "generators.yml">
```yaml
groups:
  external:
    audiences: # <---
      - external
    generators: ...
```
</CodeBlock>

By default, if no audiences are specified, then all endpoints, types, and properties are passed to the generators.

## Audiences for Endpoints

In this example, the `sendEmail` endpoint is only available to internal consumers:

<CodeBlock title="user.yml">
```yaml
service:
  base-path: /users
  auth: true
  endpoints:
    sendEmail:
      audiences: # <---
        - internal
      path: /send-email
      ...
```
</CodeBlock>

## Audiences for Types

We can mark types for different audiences. In this example, the `Email` type is available to internal and beta consumers:

<CodeBlock title = "user.yml">
```yaml 
Email: 
  properties:
    subject: string
    body: string
  audiences: # <---
    - internal
    - beta
```
</CodeBlock>

## Audiences for Properties

We can mark the properties of a type for different audiences. In this example, the `to` property is available to beta consumers:

<CodeBlock title = "user.yml">
```yaml
Email: 
  properties:
    subject: string
    body: optional<string>
    to: 
      type: optional<string>
      docs: The recipient of the email
      audiences: # <---
        - beta
```
</CodeBlock>
