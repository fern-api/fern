title: Use OpenAPI for your API definition
description: An overview of how to define your API using an OpenAPI specification, then use Fern to generate SDKs and API reference documentation for the API.
---

Fern supports the use of the [OpenAPI specification](https://www.openapis.org/) (up to and including version 3.1) to define APIs. Alternatively, you can use Fern's simpler format called [Fern Definition](/learn/overview/define-your-api/ferndef/overview).

Fern generates SDKs and API reference documentation from your OpenAPI spec. Get started by creating a `fern/` project through one of our [Quickstarts](/learn/overview/get-started), then replace the file in the `fern/openapi/` folder with your own. You can use either JSON or YAML for your file.

Run `fern check` to validate the OpenAPI spec. Resolve any errors.
Having trouble? Reach out in the [Fern Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/JkkXumPzcG).

If you're having trouble understanding the errors, run the command `fern write-definition`.
This command will convert your OpenAPI spec into a Fern Definition.

If there are no errors, you can run [fern generate](/learn/overview/cli/commands/fern-generate#for-sdks) to generate SDKs or [fern generate --docs](/learn/overview/cli/commands/fern-generate#for-documentation) to generate docs.
