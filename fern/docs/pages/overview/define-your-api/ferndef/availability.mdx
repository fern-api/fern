You can add `availability` to an endpoint, type, or property within your Fern Definition.

Availability can be:
- `in-development` which means it is being worked on; will show a `beta` tag
- `pre-release` which means it is available; will show a `beta` tag
- `deprecated` which means it will be removed in the future; will show a `deprecated` tag
- `generally-available` which means it is stable and available for use; will not show a tag

By default, all endpoints, types, and properties are `generally-available`.

## Endpoint 

<CodeBlock title="imdb.yml">
```diff
service:
  auth: false
  base-path: /movies
  endpoints:
    createMovie:
+     availability: deprecated
      docs: Add a movie to the database
      method: POST
      path: /create-movie
      request: CreateMovieRequest
      response: MovieId
