## Add content with Markdown or MDX files

Add pages manually to your documentation by creating [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) (`.md`) or [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) (`.mdx`) files and linking to them in [docs.yml](#configure-your-site-with-docs-yml).

<CodeBlock title="Example folder structure in docs.yml">
```bash
fern/
├─ fern.config.json
├─ docs.yml
└─ pages/
  ├─ welcome.mdx
```
</CodeBlock>

### Custom components
Fern has a built-in component library you can use in Markdown and MDX files. [Explore the components.](/generate-docs/component-library/)

### Frontmatter

You can optionally use frontmatter for individual page configuration.

Frontmatter must be added to the top of a `.md` or `.mdx` file, before the rest of the content. Use sets of three dashes to indicate the beginning and end of your frontmatter, as shown below.

<CodeBlock title="Example frontmatter in .md or .mdx file">
```mdx

#### title
**Type**: string<br />
**Default**: The name of the page as specified in `docs.yml`

Set the content for the [`<title>` element](https://web.dev/learn/html/document-structure#document_title) for a page. This title is displayed in browser tabs, history, and bookmarks, as well as in search engine results. Having a unique and informative title for each page benefits your site's SEO (Search Engine Optimization). For more information, see [Google's guidelines for useful titles](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/title-link#page-titles).

If no title is provided in the frontmatter of a page, the name of the page in `docs.yml` is used.

#### description
**Type**: string<br />
**Default**: None

Set the [meta description](https://web.dev/learn/html/metadata#description) for a page. Like the page title, the meta description is important for SEO. It impacts the text that search engines display about your page in search results snippets. It can also influence search engine indexing and ranking. For more information, see [Google's guidelines for meta descriptions](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/snippet#meta-descriptions).

#### editThisPageUrl
**Type**: string (absolute URL)<br />
**Default**: None

Provide the absolute link to the source `.md` or `.mdx` file in GitHub. Fern uses it to add an `Edit this page` link to the page, which users of your documentation can use to suggest corrections or additions. 

#### image
**Type**: string (absolute URL)<br />
**Default**: None

Configure the `<meta property="og:image">` metadata for a page using an absolute path to an image hosted online. This provides an image to show next to a link to your documentation when the link is shared on social media, using a metadata protocol called [OpenGraph](https://ogp.me/). For more information, see the [web.dev explanation of OpenGraph](https://web.dev/learn/html/metadata#open_graph).

### Links in Markdown
When clicked, links to relative URLs open in the same tab, whereas links to absolute URLs open in a new browser tab. 

In Markdown, use a `/` to begin a relative URL instead of `./`. 

<CodeBlock title="Relative link example">
```md
For more information, see the page on [Authentication](/home/authentication).
```
</CodeBlock>

## Configure your site with docs.yml

Every Fern Docs website has a special configuation file called `docs.yml`. Use this file to configure the navigation and styles for your documentation site.

<CodeBlock title="An example docs.yml">
```yaml
navigation:
  - section: Home
    contents:
      - page: Introduction
        path: ./intro.mdx
      - page: Authentication
        path: ./auth.mdx
  - api: API Reference
navbar-links:
  - type: secondary
    text: Contact support
    url: https://example.com/support
  - type: primary
    text: Login
    url: https://example.com/login
colors:
  accentPrimary: "#a6d388"
logo:
  path: ./images/logo.png
  height: 60
  href: https://example.com
favicon: ./images/favicon.png
```
</CodeBlock>

### Navigation

#### Sections, contents, and pages

The navigation organizes your documentation in the left-side nav bar. You can create sections for grouping related content. Each `section` has a name and a list of `contents`. The sections appear in the left-side nav bar in the order that they are listed in `docs.yml`. 

In `contents`, list your pages with names and corresponding file paths. The supported file types for pages are `.md` or `.mdx`.

A basic navigation configuration with two sections is shown below. The first section is called `Introduction` and contains a single page called `My Page`. The second section is called **API Reference**. This is a special type of section that's automatically generated by Fern, and you do not need to add any pages to it by hand. You can read more about it in the [API Reference section](#api-reference) further below.

<CodeBlock title="Example navigation config">
```yaml
navigation: 
  - section: Introduction
    contents: 
      - page: My Page
        path: ./pages/my-page.mdx
  - api: API Reference
```
</CodeBlock>

If you want to add another page to an existing section, create an `.md` or `.mdx` file. Then in `docs.yml`, create a new `page` in the `contents` list for that section, providing the path to the `.md` or `.mdx` file you created. Example:

<CodeBlock title="Example navigation config">
```yaml
navigation: 
  - section: Introduction
    contents: 
      - page: My Page
        path: ./pages/my-page.mdx
      - page: Another Page
        path: ./pages/another-page.mdx
  - api: API Reference
```
</CodeBlock>

To add another section, add another `section` to the `navigation`. Example:
<CodeBlock title="Example navigation config with additional section">
```yaml
navigation: 
  - section: Introduction
    contents: 
      - page: My Page
        path: ./pages/my-page.mdx
  - api: API Reference
  - section: Help Center
    contents: 
      - page: Contact Us
        path: contact-us.mdx
```
</CodeBlock>

#### Nested sections
If you'd like a section to toggle into more sections and pages, you can nest sections within sections. Here's an example:
<CodeBlock title="Example navigation config with nested sections">
```yaml
navigation:
  - tab: guides
    layout:
      - section: Learn
        contents: 
          - section: Key Concepts
            contents: 
              - page: Embeddings
                path: ./docs/pages/embeddings.mdx
              - page: Prompt Engineering
                path: ./docs/pages/prompts.mdx
          - section: Generation
            contents: 
              - page: Command Nightly
                path: ./docs/pages/command.mdx
              - page: Likelihood
                path: ./docs/pages/likelihood.mdx
```
</CodeBlock>

![Result of above docs.yml example](https://fern-image-hosting.s3.amazonaws.com/fern/nested-sections.png)

#### Navigation bar links

For links that you want to be easily accessible, you can specify a list of links in `navbar-links`. These links appear as buttons in the top right of your documentation website.

<CodeBlock title="Example of navbar-links config">
```yaml
navbar-links:
  - type: secondary
    text: Contact support
    url: https://example.com/support
  - type: primary
    text: Login
    url: https://example.com/login
```
</CodeBlock>

##### navbar-link type

Set the type to either `primary` or `secondary`. Primary links are designed to stand out and indicate that they are clickable with an arrow `>`. You can have one primary link.

##### navbar-link text

Set the link text that is displayed to the user.

##### navbar-link url

Set the target `url` for the link. 

To use a relative URL, make sure that you use `/` to begin the URL instead of `./`. This link opens in a new browser tab, regardless of whether it is a relative or absolute URL. 

You can use a trackable link in your URL. For example, if using [UTM parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM_parameters), instead of `https://www.example.com/login`, set the `url` to `https://www.example.com/login?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=navbar`.

## API Reference
A key benefit of using Fern Docs is that you get your API Reference with just one line. 
Add `- api: API Reference` and Fern takes care of the rest! You'll see your endpoints, types, 
and errors automatically populated from your [OpenAPI specification](/api-definition/openapi/importing-open-api).

## Styles

### Colors

#### Primary accent

You can specify a primary accent color using the [hexadecimal color](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_hexadecimal.asp). The primary accent color is used for several purposes, including:

- to indicate the page a user is on within the navigation
- as the background of a primary link button
- to underline hyperlinks
- the next and previous page navigation buttons

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
colors:
  accentPrimary: "#a6d388"
```
</CodeBlock>

#### Background

Just like `accentPrimary`, you can specify the background color using the [hexadecimal color](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_hexadecimal.asp).

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
colors:
  accentPrimary: "#a6d388"
  background:
    dark: "#0d0e11"
    light: "#ffffff"
```
</CodeBlock>

### Logo

Add a logo that displays in the top left of your documentation website.

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
logo:
  path: ./images/logo.png
  height: 60
  href: https://example.com
```
</CodeBlock>

#### Logo path

`path` specifies the image file location. The supported file types are `.png` or `.svg`.

#### Logo height

`height` sets the logo's height in pixels.

#### Logo href

`href` provides a link for the logo, often used 
to point to the website's homepage. When the logo is clicked, the user is directed to this link.

### Favicon

Specifies the path to a `favicon` image, which is typically displayed in a 
browser tab or bookmark. Supported file types are `.png` and `.ico`.

### Advanced features

The following configuration options allow you to further personalize your documentation website using `docs.yml`.

#### Fonts

You can specify custom fonts for your documentation website. The supported file types are `.woff` and `.woff2`.

Include the custom fonts in your `fern/` project:

<CodeBlock title="Example custom fonts">
```diff
  fern/
  ├─ fern.config.json
  ├─ generators.yml
  ├─ openapi/
    ├─ openapi.yml
+ ├─ fonts/
+   ├─ your-font-regular.woff2
+   ├─ your-font-bold.woff2
+   └─ another-font-regular.woff2
```
</CodeBlock>

Fern has three font types:
- `headingsFont`: affects page and section titles; if not supplied, defaults to the body font
- `bodyFont`: affects paragraph text and other body text
- `codeFont`: affects code blocks and inline code snippets

To customize the font used for each font type, add a top-level `typography` list to `docs.yml`. Then in it, specify the path of your font file for one or more of the font types.

A font has two properties:
- `name`: the name of the font; defaults to a generated name that will be used to reference your custom font in the eventually injected CSS
- `path`: the path to the font file

<CodeBlock title="Example of specifying custom fonts in docs.yml">
```yaml
typography:
  bodyFont:
    name: Inter-Regular
    path: ./fonts/Inter-Regular.woff2
  headingsFont:
    name: Inter-Bold
    path: ./fonts/Inter-Bold.woff2
  codeFont: 
    name: Roboto-Mono-Regular
    path:  ./fonts/Roboto-Mono-Regular.woff2
    name: Roboto-Mono-Regular
```
</CodeBlock>

If the font file is not variable, you can specify font weights.

A font path has three properties:
- `path`: indicate that there are multiple font files
- `weight`: a string of weights that are supported by this font file
- `style`: the style of the font file, either `normal` or `italic`

<CodeBlock title="Example of specifying font weights in docs.yml">
```yaml
typograpghy:
  bodyFont:
    name: Inter-Regular
    paths:
      - path: ./fonts/Inter-Regular.woff2
        weight: "400"
        style: normal
      - path: ./fonts/Inter-Bold.woff2
        weight: 500 900 # <-- indicates a range of weights
        style: normal
```        
</CodeBlock>

#### Tabs

Within the navigation, you can add `tabs`. Tabs are used to group sections together. The example below shows tabs for `Help Center` and `API Reference`. Each tab has a `title` and `icon`. [Browse the icons available](/generate-docs/component-library/icons) from FontAwesome.

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
tabs: 
  api: 
    display-name: API Reference
    icon: puzzle
  help:
    display-name: Help Center
    icon: home
    
 navigation: 
  - tab: api
    layout: 
      - section: Introduction
          contents: 
            - page: My Page
                path: my-page.mdx
        - api: API Reference   
  - tab: help
    layout: 
      - section: Help Center
        contents: 
          - page: Contact Us
              path: contact-us.mdx
```
</CodeBlock>

Here's an example of what the Tabs implementation looks like:
![Screenshot showing two vertically stacked tabs labeled API Reference and Help Center](https://fern-image-hosting.s3.amazonaws.com/fern/tabs.png)

#### Versions

If you have multiple versions of your documentation, you can introduce a dropdown version selector by specifying the `versions`.

![A dropdown of the available versions](https://fern-image-hosting.s3.amazonaws.com/versions.png)

When adding an entry to the `versions` list, specify the version's `display-name`, which is visible to users, and `path`, which is a file that must be in a folder called `versions/`:

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
versions: 
  - display-name: v1.0
      path: v1-0.yml # must be in a `versions` folder
  - display-name: v1.1
      path: v1-1.yml
```
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock title="versions/v1-0.yml">
```yaml
navigation: 
  - section: Introduction
    contents: 
      - page: My Page
        path: my-page.mdx
  - api: API Reference
```
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock title="versions/v1-1.yml">
```yaml
tabs: 
  api: 
    title: API Reference
    icon: puzzle
  help:
    title: Help Center
    icon: home
    
 navigation: 
  - tab: api
     contents: 
        - section: Introduction
           contents: 
              - page: My Page
                 path: my-page.mdx
        - api: API Reference   
   - tab: help
      contents: 
         - section: Help Center
           contents: 
              - page: Contact Us
                 path: contact-us.mdx
```
</CodeBlock>
