### 1. Adding your domain to `docs.yml`

First decide what subdomain to use with your documentation. 
The most common options are https://docs.example.com or https://example.com/docs.

We'll add the following to `docs.yml` to tell Fern Docs to 
publish to `example.docs.buildwithfern.com`:

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
instances: 
  - url: example.docs.buildwithfern.com
```
</CodeBlock>

When ready to publish to a custom domain, add the `custom-domain` key to the instance. Note that this is a paid feature. For example:

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```diff 
instances: 
  - url: example.docs.buildwithfern.com
+   custom-domain: docs.example.com
```
</CodeBlock>

### 2. Running the generator

In the example above, by running `fern generate --docs`, we'd see:

<CodeBlock title="Terminal">
```bash
┌─
│ ⠂ Publish docs
└─
```
</CodeBlock>

followed by

<CodeBlock title="Terminal">
```bash
[api]: Published docs to https://example.docs.buildwithfern.com
┌─
│ ✓ Publish docs
└─
```
</CodeBlock>

### 3. Creating DNS records to point at Fern Docs

Next, you'll need to get the DNS records by adding Fern Docs to your subscription. 
You can do this by reaching out [sales@buildwithfern.com](mailto:sales@buildwithfern.com).
