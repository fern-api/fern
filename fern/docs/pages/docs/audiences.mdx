[Audiences](/api-definition/fern-definition/audiences) are a useful tool for segmenting your API for different consumers. You can configure your Fern Docs to publish documentation specific to an `Audience`.

The following example shows how to configure your `docs.yml` to publish documentation for the `public` audience.

<CodeBlock title = "docs.yml">
```diff 
navigation:
  - api: API Reference
+   audiences:
+     - public
```
</CodeBlock>
