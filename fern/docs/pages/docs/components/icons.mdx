[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) is the Internet's icon library and toolkit, used by millions of designers, developers, and content creators. We use Font Awesome to power the icons within Fern Docs. 

You can pick from the 26,000+ icons available and then apply a style, color, size, or animation to them.

If you'd like to B.Y.O.I. (Bring Your Own Icons), reach out to us at [support@buildwithfern.com](mailto:support@buildwithfern.com). This is a paid feature available on our `Business plan`.

## Styling icons

Font Awesome icons can be styled to really make your project look its best. You can pick icons that are avaiable under the `Pro` plan. Fern does not support the `SVG+JS` method.
