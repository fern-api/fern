The `Availability` component is used to indicate the availability status of an endpoint.

Availability Prop:

**type**: 'beta' | 'GA' | 'deprecated'

## Beta availability 

Indicates that an endpoint is in <Availability type="beta" />. This means that the endpoint is still in development and may change before it is released to the public. 

```mdx
<Availability type="beta" />
```

## General availability

Indicates that an endpoint is <Availability type="GA" />. This means that the endpoint is ready for use in production. 

```mdx
<Availability type="GA" />
```

## Deprecated availability

Indicates that an endpoint is <Availability type="deprecated" />. This means that the endpoint is no longer supported and will be removed in a future release.

```mdx
<Availability type="deprecated" />
```
