The `Callout Component` is used when you want to visually highlight important content for the user. There are different props available to design callout component properly.

Note: it is helpful to add a `<br />` after the callout component to ensure that the next component is not too close to the callout.

Callout Prop:

**intent**: 'info' | 'success' | 'warn'

## Info 

<Callout intent="info">
This is an info callout. 
</Callout>

<br />

<CodeBlock title = "info">
```mdx
<Callout intent="info">
This is an info callout. 
</Callout>
```
</CodeBlock>

<br />

## Success 

<Callout intent="success">
This is a success callout. 
</Callout>

<br />

<CodeBlock title = "success">
```mdx
<Callout intent="success">
This is a success callout. 
</Callout>
```
</CodeBlock>

## Warning

<Callout intent="warn">
This is a warn callout. 
</Callout>

<br />

<CodeBlock title = "warn">
```mdx
<Callout intent="warn">
This is a warn callout. 
</Callout>
```
</CodeBlock>
