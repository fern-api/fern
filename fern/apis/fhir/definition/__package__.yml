          element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification.
          To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set
          of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
          implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
          that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
          processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier

      the medication in the past or will be taking the medication in the future.  The
      source of this information can be the patient, significant other (such as a
      family member or spouse), or a clinician.  A common scenario where this information
      is captured is during the history taking process during a patient visit or stay.   The
      medication information may come from sources such as the patient's memory, from
      a prescription bottle,  or from a list of medications the patient, clinician
      or other party maintains.  The primary difference between a medication statement
      and a medication administration is that the medication administration has complete
      administration information and is based on actual administration information
      from the person who administered the medication.  A medication statement is
      often, if not always, less specific.  There is no required date/time when the
      medication was administered, in fact we only know that a source has reported
      the patient is taking this medication, where details such as time, quantity,
      or rate or even medication product may be incomplete or missing or less precise.  As
      stated earlier, the medication statement information may come from the patient's
      memory, from a prescription bottle or from a list of medications the patient,
      clinician or other party maintains.  Medication administration is more formal
      and is not missing detailed information.
