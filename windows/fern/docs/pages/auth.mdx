To access the API, you'll need:
- An Entra App with appropriate permissions
- An authentication library that supports Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL):
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/msal-overview

## Creating an Entra App
<Warning>Note: Only Entra ID Global Administrators can create applications. This process will create a single-tenant application requiring admin consent.</Warning>

1. Navigate to "Microsoft Entra Applications" in Business Central
2. Select "Actions" -> "Entra App Management" -> "Create Entra App"
3. Enter a name for your application
4. Select the required permissions - typically one permission set per API group (e.g., "POS", "Memberships")
5. Click "Create Microsoft Entra Application"
6. Grant admin consent
7. Record the client_id and client_secret - the client_secret cannot be retrieved after initial creation
8. You can now use these credentials to authenticate your API requests

## OAuth Authentication
To obtain an access token from Entra ID, you'll need:
- Scope: "https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/.default"
- Token URL: "https://login.microsoftonline.com/:tenantId/oauth2/v2.0/token"

For testing in Postman:
- Set Authorization type to OAuth 2.0
- Use "Client Credentials" grant type
- Set scope to "https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/.default"
- Set token URL to "https://login.microsoftonline.com/:tenantId/oauth2/v2.0/token"
