@devin-ai-integration Please resolve this Dependabot security alert.

**Instructions:**
1. Analyze the vulnerability and understand its impact
2. Update the affected dependency to a secure version. If updating a poetry lock file, use the same version of poetry used to generate the existing one.
3. Ideally resolve this without using an override - prefer updating the dependency directly
4. If an override is absolutely necessary, document why in the PR description
5. Run tests to ensure the update doesn't break anything
6. Push your fix to this PR branch and tag @davidkonigsberg for review
7. Delete the scaffold file (.github/dependabot-alerts/alert-*.md) as part of your fix
8. Update the PR title, if needed, to pass CI checks

**Alert Details:**

- **Package:** minimatch (npm)
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Vulnerable versions:** < 10.2.1
- **Patched version:** 10.2.1
- **CVE:** CVE-2026-26996
- **GHSA:** GHSA-3ppc-4f35-3m26
- **Manifest:** pnpm-lock.yaml

**Summary:**
minimatch has a ReDoS via repeated wildcards with non-matching literal in pattern

**Description:**
### Summary
`minimatch` is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) when a glob pattern contains many consecutive `*` wildcards followed by a literal character that doesn't appear in the test string. Each `*` compiles to a separate `[^/]*?` regex group, and when the match fails, V8's regex engine backtracks exponentially across all possible splits.

The time complexity is O(4^N) where N is the number of `*` characters. With N=15, a single `minimatch()` call takes ~2 seconds. With N=34, it hangs effectively forever.


### Details
_Give all details on the vulnerability. Pointing to the incriminated source code is very helpful for the maintainer._

### PoC
When minimatch compiles a glob pattern, each `*` becomes `[^/]*?` in the generated regex. For a pattern like `***************X***`:

```
/^(?!\.)[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?X[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?$/
```

When the test string doesn't contain `X`, the regex engine must try every possible way to distribute the characters across all the `[^/]*?` groups before concluding no match exists. With N groups and M characters, this is O(C(N+M, N)) — exponential.
### Impact
Any application that passes user-controlled strings to `minimatch()` as the pattern argument is vulnerable to DoS. This includes:
- File search/filter UIs that accept glob patterns
- `.gitignore`-style filtering with user-defined rules
- Build tools that accept glob configuration
- Any API that exposes glob matching to untrusted input
