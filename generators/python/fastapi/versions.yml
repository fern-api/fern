    - type: fix
      summary: |
        The FastAPI generator now supports a new mode for pydantic model generation,
        to use pydantic v1 on v2 versions. 

        ```yml generators.yml
        generators: 
          server: 
            - name: fernapi/fern-fastapi-server

    - type: fix
      summary: |
        A missing configuration now respects the pydantic version configuration, as such, the base model for discriminated unions generated with utilities
        now respects which version of Pydantic you are generating for.

  irVersion: 53
  changelogEntry:
    - type: fix
      summary: |
        Pydantic utilities now correctly handles cases where you have a Pydantic model, with a list of pydantic models as a field, where those models have literals.
        Effectively, `deep_union_pydantic_objects` now handles lists of objects and merges them appropriately.

- version: 1.5.0-rc4
  irVersion: 53
  changelogEntry:
    - type: fix
      summary: |
        Use of `IS_PYDANTIC_V2` flag is now only used within universal base models (`pydantic_utilities.py`) and if pydantic version compatibility is not specified
        or set to `Both`. Concretely, this means that if your configuration specifies a version for Pydantic, then your generated code will respect that version, and
        generate the code for that specific version of Pydantic, as opposed to always generating code compatible with both versions of Pydantic.

          `exclude_unset` is now respected when passed in as an option to a model's `.dict` call.

  changelogEntry:
    - type: fix
      summary: |
        The FastAPI server generation now adds model configuration back onto the union utils root model a change that was made when Pydantic V2 support was rolled out, believing
        it was not allowed in Pydantic V2.

- version: 1.5.0-rc1
  irVersion: 53
  changelogEntry:
    - type: fix
      summary: |
        When leveraging the `include_union_utils` configuration flag, the Pydantic models will no longer include transitive dependencies within
        `update_forward_ref` calls, since these should not be necessary. This effectively scopes back the changes introduced in 1.5.0-rc0, which included
        changes to improve circular reference handling in Pydantic models.

      summary: The FastAPI server generation now supports endpoints with file upload as well as endpoints with file download.

- version: 1.4.9
  irVersion: 53
  changelogEntry:
    - type: fix
      summary: Default on `pydantic aliases`
      fixed:
        - The previous version of the FastAPI generator defaulted on a setting
          which removed pydantic aliases. Because FastAPI calls into the
          pydantic serializers itself, the generated models must have
          aliases.

- version: 1.4.8
  irVersion: 53
  changelogEntry:
    - type: chore
      summary: Remove Pydantic field aliases and leverage an internal representation
      fixed:
        - >-
          Pydantic field aliases are removed and replaced with an internal
          representation. This allows for more robust handling of field aliases
          and prevents issues with Pydantic V2 and mypy.

          Previously, you'd have for V1 and V2 compatibility in Pydantic, you'd want to conditionally apply the config class within
          the base model, however this would lead to mypy errors when filling out a model with it's field alias. To solve this, We
          used the deprecated `class Config`, regardless of the Pydantic version to satisfy mypy, which lead to warnings in the console.

          Now, we've removed the field aliases and replaced them with an internal representation, which allows us to avoid pydantic config altogether.

          If you'd like to disable this feature, you can set `use_pydantic_field_aliases` to `true` in your configuration, which will preserve the existing behavior.

          To maintain parity with pre-3.11.0 behavior, update the flag to `true`:

            ```yaml
            - name: fernapi/fern-fastapi-server
              version: 1.4.8
              config:
                pydantic_config:
                  use_pydantic_field_aliases: true
            ```

        - >-
          Pydantic V2 `.dict` calls are updated to be back to pre-3.10.4 logic.
          This is fix a regression where nested literals were being omitted due to the Pydantic V2 serializers not respecting the recursive .dict logic, as
          Pydantic V2 shells out `model_dump` calls to Rust library and serializers, as opposed to recursively calling `model_dump`.

          It is expected that performance will not be degraded given the Rust-based serializers have optimized performance, compared to the Pydantic V1 .dict approach.

      changed:
        - >-
          `.dict` performance is improved, consolidating to a single call to
          Pydantic's `.dict` instead of 2 in attempts to remove unset optional
          values.

      fixed:

          The generator has now been upgraded to use Pydantic V2 internally.
          Note that there is no change to the generated code, however by
          leveraging Pydantic V2 you should notice an improvement in `fern
