        Fix wire test WireMock container lifecycle to be compatible with pytest-xdist parallelization.
        The container is now started/stopped using pytest_configure/pytest_unconfigure hooks instead of
        a session-scoped fixture, ensuring only the controller process manages the container.
      type: fix
