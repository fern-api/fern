        Fix WireMock stub generation for streaming endpoints. When an endpoint has both streaming
        and non-streaming variants (via x-fern-streaming with stream-condition), the generated
        WireMock stubs now include request body matching criteria to differentiate between them.
        SSE stubs match on `stream: true` in the request body and have higher priority, ensuring
        wire tests correctly route streaming requests to the SSE stub.
      type: fix
