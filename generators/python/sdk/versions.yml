        Requests for file download will now allow users to pass in a `chunk_size` option that allows them to receive chunks of a specific size
        from the resultant `iter_bytes` invocation on the response byte stream.

        Concretely, a user would leverage the following:
        ```python
        client.download(
          ...,
          request_options={
            "chunk_size": 1024    # 1MB

      summary: |
        Now, when sending Snippet Templates back to Fern, the generator will not try to coerce a potentially missing ID into the `api_definition_id` field.
        This, had been a cause of the error log `Failed to upload snippet templates to FDR, this is ok: one of the hex, bytes, bytes_le, fields, or int arguments must be given`.

      summary: |
        Pydantic utilities now correctly handles cases where you have a Pydantic model, with a list of pydantic models as a field, where those models have literals.
        Effectively, `deep_union_pydantic_objects` now handles lists of objects and merges them appropriately.

- version: 4.2.7-rc1
  irVersion: 53
  changelogEntry:
    - type: fix
      summary: |
        When leveraging the `include_union_utils` configuration flag, the Pydantic models will no longer include transitive dependencies within
        `update_forward_ref` calls, since these should not be necessary. This effectively scopes back the changes introduced in 4.0.0-rc5, which included
        changes to improve circular reference handling in Pydantic models.

        The content type of file properties is now respected for multipart
        requests. For example, if you have a file property called `image` that has the
        content type `image/jpeg`, then it will be sent as:

        ```python
        "image": core.with_content_type(file=image, content_type="image/jpeg"),
        ````

    - type: fix
      summary: |
        The content type of non-file properties is now respected for multipart
        requests. For example, if you have a type called `metadata` that has the
        content type `application/json`, then it will be sent as:

      summary: |
        Allow specifying arbitrary configuration to your packages `pyproject.toml` by adding a `pyproject_toml` block to your configuration
        whatever you include in this block will be added as-is to the `pyproject.toml` file. The config, as an example is:

        ```yaml
        config:
          pyproject_toml: |
            [tool.covcheck.group.unit.coverage]
            branch = 26.0

              version: "^0.4.3"
              extras: ["toml"]
        ```

        would add the following to your `pyproject.toml`:

        ```toml
        [tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]
        covcheck = { version = "^0.4.3", extras = ["toml"] }
        ```

        Generated tests that expect an empty result when they are of type `text` (not JSON) now appropriately expect an empty string instead of `None` for async functions as well.

      summary: All Pydantic V2 warnings have been resolved
      fixed:
        - json_encoders have been removed from Pydantic V2, and replaced with a `model_serializer` method.
        - additional model construction functions have been added when not leveraging pydantic field aliases to allow users to construct a model from JSOn without the need for dealiasing the object themselves.

      summary: |
        Pydantic models that call `update_forward_refs` on non-union circular reference dependencies now pass in `localns` for
        the current member, a field in Pydantic V1 that provides object contexts to models in the event objects are not fully rebuilt.

    - type: fix
      summary: Update .dict calls in Pydantic V2 to be back to pre-3.10.4 logic for SDKs that continue using Pydantic aliases.

- version: 4.0.0-rc1
  irVersion: 53
  changelogEntry:
    - type: fix
      summary: Update .dict calls in Pydantic V2 to be back to pre-3.10.4 logic.
      fixed:
        - >-
          Pydantic V2 `.dict` calls are updated to be back to pre-3.10.4 logic.
          This is fix a regression where nested literals were being omitted due to the Pydantic V2 serializers not respecting the recursive .dict logic, as
          Pydantic V2 shells out `model_dump` calls to Rust library and serializers, as opposed to recursively calling `model_dump`.

          It is expected that performance will not be degraded given the Rust-based serializers have optimized performance, compared to the Pydantic V1 .dict approach.

  changelogEntry:
    - type: fix
      summary: Rerelease 3.11.0-rc0 as a major version, with a configuration flag to disable the behavior (`use_pydantic_field_aliases`), defaulted to `true` to preserve existing behavior.
      fixed:
        - >-
          Rerelease 3.11.0-rc0 as a major version, with a configuration flag to
          disable the behavior (`use_pydantic_field_aliases`), defaulted to `false`
          to introduce the break on a major version.

          To maintain parity with pre-3.11.0 behavior, update the flag to `true`:

            ```yaml
            - name: fernapi/fern-python-sdk
              version: 4.0.0-rc0

      summary: Remove Pydantic field aliases and leverage an internal representation.
      fixed:
        - >-
          Pydantic field aliases are removed and replaced with an internal
          representation. This allows for more robust handling of field aliases
          and prevents issues with Pydantic V2 and mypy.

          Previously, you'd have for V1 and V2 compatibility in Pydantic, you'd want to conditionally apply the config class within
          the base model, however this would lead to mypy errors when filling out a model with it's field alias. To solve this, We
          used the deprecated `class Config`, regardless of the Pydantic version to satisfy mypy, which lead to warnings in the console.

          Now, we've removed the field aliases and replaced them with an internal representation, which allows us to avoid pydantic config altogether.

- version: 3.10.8
  irVersion: 53

          pagination, same as if the next cursor were `None`.

          Adds a new flag to generate forward compatible Python enums, as opposed
          to leveraging raw string enums as literals. This works through addding

      added:

          A new configuration is introduced to make discriminated union member
          naming more Pythonic. With V1 union naming, member names change from
          `<UnionName>_<DiscriminantValue>` to `<DiscriminantValue><UnionName>`.

          Improvement: The root client users interact with is now exported from
          the main `__init__.py`, this allows users to access the client via `from
          my_sdk import my_sdk_client` as opposed to `from my_sdk.client import
          my_sdk_client`.

          Note this comes with an edge-case break. In the unlikely event you have
          a type that conflicts in naming with the exported root client, that type
          model is post-fixed with "Model". e.g. a type `Merge` in an SDK
          exporting a client `Merge` becomes `MergeModel`.
