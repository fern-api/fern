features:
  - id: USAGE
    description: |
      Instantiate and use the client with the following:

  - id: ASYNC_CLIENT
    description: |
      The SDK also exports an `async` client so that you can make non-blocking calls to our API.

  - id: EXCEPTION_HANDLING
    description: |
      When the API returns a non-success status code (4xx or 5xx response), a subclass of the following error
      will be thrown.

  - id: STREAMING
    description: |
      The SDK supports streaming responses, as well, the response will be a generator that you can loop over.

  - id: PAGINATION
    description: |
      Paginated requests will return a `SyncPager` or `AsyncPager`, which can be used as generators for the underlying object.

  - id: RETRIES
    description: |
      The SDK is instrumented with automatic retries with exponential backoff. A request will be retried as long
      as the request is deemed retryable and the number of retry attempts has not grown larger than the configured
      retry limit (default: 2).

      A request is deemed retryable when any of the following HTTP status codes is returned:

      - [408](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/408) (Timeout)
      - [429](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429) (Too Many Requests)
      - [5XX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/500) (Internal Server Errors)

      Use the `max_retries` request option to configure this behavior.

  - id: TIMEOUTS
    description: |
      The SDK defaults to a 60 second timeout. You can configure this with a timeout option at the client or request level.


  - id: CUSTOM_CLIENT
    description: |
      You can override the `httpx` client to customize it for your use-case. Some common use-cases include support for proxies
      and transports.
