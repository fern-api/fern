      Instantiate and use the client with the following:

  - id: ENVIRONMENTS
    description: |
      By default, the production environment is used. However, you can choose between different environments by using
      the `option.WithBaseURL` option. You can configure any arbitrary base URL, which is particularly useful
      in test environments.

  - id: ERRORS
    description: |
      Structured error types are returned from API calls that return non-success status codes. These errors are compatible
      with the `errors.Is` and `errors.As` APIs, so you can access the error like so:

  - id: RETRIES
    advanced: true

      The SDK is instrumented with automatic retries with exponential backoff. A request will be retried as long
      as the request is deemed retryable and the number of retry attempts has not grown larger than the configured
      retry limit (default: 2).

      A request is deemed retryable when any of the following HTTP status codes is returned:

      - [408](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/408) (Timeout)
      - [429](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429) (Too Many Requests)
      - [5XX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/500) (Internal Server Errors)

      Use the `option.WithMaxAttempts` option to configure this behavior for the entire client or an individual request:

  - id: TIMEOUTS
    advanced: true

      Setting a timeout for each individual request is as simple as using the standard context library. Setting a one second timeout for an individual API call looks like the following:
