features:
  - id: USAGE
    description: |
      Instantiate and use the client with the following:

  - id: ENVIRONMENTS
    description: |
      You can choose between different environments by using the `option.WithBaseURL` option. You can configure any arbitrary base
      URL, which is particularly useful in test environments.

  - id: PAGINATION
    description: |
      List endpoints are paginated. The SDK provides an iterator so that you can simply loop over the items. You can also iterate page-by-page using the `GetNextPage` helper method. If need be you can access the raw response using the `RawResponse` field on the page.

  - id: ERRORS
    description: |
      Structured error types are returned from API calls that return non-success status codes. These errors are compatible
      with the `errors.Is` and `errors.As` APIs, so you can access the error like so:

  - id: REQUEST_OPTIONS
    description: |
      A variety of request options are included to adapt the behavior of the library, which includes configuring
      authorization tokens, or providing your own instrumented `*http.Client`.

      These request options can either be
      specified on the client so that they're applied on every request, or for an individual request, like so:

      > Providing your own `*http.Client` is recommended. Otherwise, the `http.DefaultClient` will be used,
      > and your client will wait indefinitely for a response (unless the per-request, context-based timeout
      > is used).

  - id: RESPONSE_HEADERS
    advanced: true
    description: |
      You can access the raw HTTP response data by using the `WithRawResponse` field on the client. This is useful
      when you need to examine the response headers received from the API call.

  - id: RETRIES
    advanced: true
    description: |
      The SDK is instrumented with automatic retries with exponential backoff. A request will be retried as long
      as the request is deemed retryable and the number of retry attempts has not grown larger than the configured
      retry limit (default: 2).

      A request is deemed retryable when any of the following HTTP status codes is returned:

      - [408](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/408) (Timeout)
      - [429](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429) (Too Many Requests)
      - [5XX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/500) (Internal Server Errors)

      If the `Retry-After` header is present in the response, the SDK will prioritize respecting its value exactly
      over the default exponential backoff.

      Use the `option.WithMaxAttempts` option to configure this behavior for the entire client or an individual request:

  - id: TIMEOUTS
    advanced: true
    description: |
      Setting a timeout for each individual request is as simple as using the standard context library. Setting a one second timeout for an individual API call looks like the following:

  - id: EXPLICIT_NULL
    advanced: true
    description: |
      If you want to send the explicit `null` JSON value through an optional parameter, you can use the setters\
      that come with every object. Calling a setter method for a property will flip a bit in the `explicitFields`
      bitfield for that setter's object; during serialization, any property with a flipped bit will have its
      omittable status stripped, so zero or `nil` values will be sent explicitly rather than omitted altogether:
