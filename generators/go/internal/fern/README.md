# internal/fern

The `internal/fern` directory contains packages generated by `fern`.
This includes the IntermediateRepresentation, which was once written
by hand but is now consumed from this package (i.e. compiler bootstrapping).

Note that this generator was written with IR v20, and that is what
is found in `ir.json`.
