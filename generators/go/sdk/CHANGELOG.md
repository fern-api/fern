## [0.17.0-rc1] - 2024-02-23

## [0.17.0-rc0] - 2024-02-21

- Fix: Package documentation is now generated into the correct package's `doc.go`.
- Feature: Add support for generated endpoint snippets.

    snippets API.
  - The snippets are _not_ embedded in the SDK itself (yet).

```go
import (
  context "context"
  time "time"
  acme "github.com/acme/acme-go"
  acmeclient "github.com/acme/acme-go/client"
  option "github.com/acme/acme-go/option"
)

client := acmeclient.NewClient(
  option.WithToken(
    "<YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN>",
  ),
)
response, err := client.User.Create(
  context.TODO(),
  &acme.CreateUserRequest{
    Username: "john",
    Language: acme.LanguageEnglish,
    Age:      acme.Int(32),
