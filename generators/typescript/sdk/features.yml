features:
  - id: USAGE
    description: |
      Instantiate and use the client with the following:

  - id: REQUEST_AND_RESPONSE_TYPES
    description: |
      The SDK exports all request and response types as TypeScript interfaces. Simply import them with the
      following namespace:

  - id: EXCEPTION_HANDLING
    description: |
      When the API returns a non-success status code (4xx or 5xx response), a subclass of the following error
      will be thrown.

  - id: STREAMING_RESPONSE
    description: |
      Some endpoints return streaming responses instead of returning the full response at once.
      The SDK uses async iterators, so you can consume the responses using a `for await...of` loop.

  - id: FILE_UPLOADS
    description: |
      You can upload files using the client:
    addendum: |
      The client accepts a variety of types for file upload parameters:
      * Stream types: `fs.ReadStream`, `stream.Readable`, and `ReadableStream`
      * Buffered types: `Buffer`, `Blob`, `File`, `ArrayBuffer`, `ArrayBufferView`, and `Uint8Array`

      ### Metadata

      You can configure metadata when uploading a file:
      ```typescript
      const file: Uploadable.WithMetadata = {
          data: createReadStream("path/to/file"),
          filename: "my-file",       // optional
          contentType: "audio/mpeg", // optional
          contentLength: 1949,       // optional
      };
      ```

      Alternatively, you can upload a file directly from a file path:
      ```typescript
      const file : Uploadable.FromPath = {
          path: "path/to/file",
          filename: "my-file",        // optional
          contentType: "audio/mpeg",  // optional
          contentLength: 1949,        // optional
      };
      ```

      The metadata is used to set the `Content-Length`, `Content-Type`, and `Content-Disposition` headers. If not provided, the client will attempt to determine them automatically.
      For example, `fs.ReadStream` has a `path` property which the SDK uses to retrieve the file size from the filesystem without loading it into memory.

  - id: BINARY_RESPONSE
    description: |
      You can consume binary data from endpoints using the `BinaryResponse` type which lets you choose how to consume the data:

  - id: PAGINATION
    description: |
      List endpoints are paginated. The SDK provides an iterator so that you can simply loop over the items:

  - id: ADDITIONAL_HEADERS
    advanced: true
    description: |
      If you would like to send additional headers as part of the request, use the `headers` request option.

  - id: ADDITIONAL_QUERY_STRING_PARAMETERS
    advanced: true
    description: |
      If you would like to send additional query string parameters as part of the request, use the `queryParams` request option.

  - id: RETRIES
    advanced: true
    description: |
      The SDK is instrumented with automatic retries with exponential backoff. A request will be retried as long
      as the request is deemed retryable and the number of retry attempts has not grown larger than the configured
      retry limit (default: 2).

      A request is deemed retryable when any of the following HTTP status codes is returned:

      - [408](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/408) (Timeout)
      - [429](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429) (Too Many Requests)
      - [5XX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/500) (Internal Server Errors)

      Use the `maxRetries` request option to configure this behavior.

  - id: TIMEOUTS
    advanced: true
    description: |
      The SDK defaults to a 60 second timeout. Use the `timeoutInSeconds` option to configure this behavior.

  - id: ABORTING_REQUESTS
    advanced: true
    description: |
      The SDK allows users to abort requests at any point by passing in an abort signal.

  - id: ACCESS_RAW_RESPONSE_DATA
    advanced: true
    description: |
      The SDK provides access to raw response data, including headers, through the `.withRawResponse()` method.
      The `.withRawResponse()` method returns a promise that results to an object with a `data` and a `rawResponse` property.

  - id: LOGGING
    description: |
      The SDK supports logging. You can configure the logger by passing in a `logging` object to the client options.
    addendum: |
      The `logging` object can have the following properties:
      - `level`: The log level to use. Defaults to `logging.LogLevel.Info`.
      - `logger`: The logger to use. Defaults to `logging.ConsoleLogger`.
      - `silent`: Whether to silence the logger. Defaults to `true`.

      The `level` property can be one of the following values:
      - `logging.LogLevel.Debug`
      - `logging.LogLevel.Info`
      - `logging.LogLevel.Warn`
      - `logging.LogLevel.Error`

      To provide a custom logger, you can pass in a custom logger implementation that implements the `logging.ILogger` interface.
      Here's an example using the popular `winston` logging library.
      ```ts
      import winston from 'winston';

      const winstonLogger = winston.createLogger({...});
      const logger: logging.ILogger = {
          debug: (msg, ...args) => winstonLogger.debug(msg, ...args),
          info: (msg, ...args) => winstonLogger.info(msg, ...args),
          warn: (msg, ...args) => winstonLogger.warn(msg, ...args),
          error: (msg, ...args) => winstonLogger.error(msg, ...args),
      };
      ```

    advanced: true

      <% if (fetchSupport === "node-fetch") { %>
      The SDK defaults to `node-fetch` but will use the global fetch client if present. The SDK works in the following
      runtimes:
      <% } else { %>

      ### Customizing Fetch Client

      The SDK provides a way for you to customize the underlying HTTP client / Fetch function. If you're running in an
      unsupported environment, this provides a way for you to break glass and ensure the SDK works.
