      Instantiate and use the client with the following:

  - id: REQUEST_AND_RESPONSE_TYPES
    description: |
      The SDK exports all request and response types as TypeScript interfaces. Simply import them with the
      following namespace:

  - id: EXCEPTION_HANDLING
    description: |
      When the API returns a non-success status code (4xx or 5xx response), a subclass of the following error
      will be thrown.
  
  - id: PAGINATION
    description: | 
      List endpoints are paginated. The SDK provides an iterator so that you can simply loop over the items:
 
  # - id: RAW_RESPONSES
  #   advanced: true
  #   description: | 
  #     The SDK provides access to raw response data, including headers, through the `.asRaw()` method. When using `.asRaw()`, 
  #     the parsed response body will be available in the `body` field, along with the response headers:
  
  - id: ADDITIONAL_HEADERS
    advanced: true
    description: | 
      If you would like to send additional headers as part of the request, use the `headers` request option. 
  
  - id: RETRIES
    advanced: true
    description: |
      The SDK is instrumented with automatic retries with exponential backoff. A request will be retried as long
      as the request is deemed retriable and the number of retry attempts has not grown larger than the configured
      retry limit (default: 2).

      A request is deemed retriable when any of the following HTTP status codes is returned:
      
      - [408](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/408) (Timeout)
      - [429](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429) (Too Many Requests)
      - [5XX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/500) (Internal Server Errors)

      Use the `maxRetries` request option to configure this behavior.

  - id: TIMEOUTS
    advanced: true
    description: |
      The SDK defaults to a 60 second timeout. Use the `timeoutInSeconds` option to configure this behavior.

  - id: ABORTING_REQUESTS
    advanced: true
    description: |
      The SDK allows users to abort requests at any point by passing in an abort signal.

  - id: RUNTIME_COMPATIBILITY
    advanced: true
    description: |
      The SDK works in the following runtimes:

      - Node.js 18+
      - Vercel
      - Cloudflare Workers
      - Deno v1.25+
      - Bun 1.0+
      - React Native

      ### Customizing Fetch Client

      The SDK provides a way for your to customize the underlying HTTP client / Fetch function. If you're running in an
      unsupported environment, this provides a way for you to break glass and ensure the SDK works.
