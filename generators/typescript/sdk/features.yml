features:
  - id: USAGE
    description: |
      Instantiate and use the client with the following:

  - id: REQUEST_AND_RESPONSE_TYPES
    description: |
      The SDK exports all request and response types as TypeScript interfaces. Simply import them with the
      following namespace:

  - id: EXCEPTION_HANDLING
    description: |
      When the API returns a non-success status code (4xx or 5xx response), a subclass of the following error
      will be thrown.

  - id: STREAMING_RESPONSE
    description: |
      Some endpoints return streaming responses instead of returning the full response at once.
      The SDK uses async iterators, so you can consume the responses using a `for await...of` loop.

  - id: FILE_UPLOADS
    description: |
      You can upload files using the client:
    addendum: |
      The client accepts a variety of types for file upload parameters:
      * Stream types: `fs.ReadStream`, `stream.Readable`, and `ReadableStream`
      * Buffered types: `Buffer`, `Blob`, `File`, `ArrayBuffer`, `ArrayBufferView`, and `Uint8Array`

      ### Metadata

      You can configure metadata when uploading a file:
      ```typescript
      const file: Uploadable.WithMetadata = {
          data: createReadStream("path/to/file"),
          filename: "my-file",       // optional
          contentType: "audio/mpeg", // optional
          contentLength: 1949,       // optional
      };
      ```

      Alternatively, you can upload a file directly from a file path:
      ```typescript
      const file : Uploadable.FromPath = {
          path: "path/to/file",
          filename: "my-file",        // optional
          contentType: "audio/mpeg",  // optional
          contentLength: 1949,        // optional
      };
      ```

      The metadata is used to set the `Content-Length`, `Content-Type`, and `Content-Disposition` headers. If not provided, the client will attempt to determine them automatically.
      For example, `fs.ReadStream` has a `path` property which the SDK uses to retrieve the file size from the filesystem without loading it into memory.

  - id: BINARY_RESPONSE
    description: |
      You can consume binary data from endpoints using the `BinaryResponse` type which lets you choose how to consume the data:

  - id: PAGINATION
    description: |
      List endpoints are paginated. The SDK provides an iterator so that you can simply loop over the items:

  - id: ADDITIONAL_HEADERS
    advanced: true
    description: |
      If you would like to send additional headers as part of the request, use the `headers` request option.

  - id: ADDITIONAL_QUERY_STRING_PARAMETERS
    advanced: true
    description: |
      If you would like to send additional query string parameters as part of the request, use the `queryParams` request option.

  - id: RETRIES
    advanced: true
    description: |
      The SDK is instrumented with automatic retries with exponential backoff. A request will be retried as long
      as the request is deemed retryable and the number of retry attempts has not grown larger than the configured
      retry limit (default: 2).

      A request is deemed retryable when any of the following HTTP status codes is returned:

      - [408](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/408) (Timeout)
      - [429](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429) (Too Many Requests)
      - [5XX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/500) (Internal Server Errors)

      Use the `maxRetries` request option to configure this behavior.

  - id: TIMEOUTS
    advanced: true
    description: |
      The SDK defaults to a 60 second timeout. Use the `timeoutInSeconds` option to configure this behavior.

  - id: ABORTING_REQUESTS
    advanced: true
    description: |
      The SDK allows users to abort requests at any point by passing in an abort signal.

  - id: ACCESS_RAW_RESPONSE_DATA
    advanced: true
    description: |
      The SDK provides access to raw response data, including headers, through the `.withRawResponse()` method.
      The `.withRawResponse()` method returns a promise that results to an object with a `data` and a `rawResponse` property.

  - id: RUNTIME_COMPATIBILITY
    advanced: true
    description: |
      <% if (fetchSupport === "node-fetch") { %>
      The SDK defaults to `node-fetch` but will use the global fetch client if present. The SDK works in the following
      runtimes:
      <% } else { %>
      The SDK works in the following runtimes:
      <% } %>


      - Node.js 18+
      - Vercel
      - Cloudflare Workers
      - Deno v1.25+
      - Bun 1.0+
      - React Native

      ### Customizing Fetch Client

      The SDK provides a way for you to customize the underlying HTTP client / Fetch function. If you're running in an
      unsupported environment, this provides a way for you to break glass and ensure the SDK works.

  - id: FETCH_CONFIGURATION
    advanced: true
    description: |
      The SDK allows you to configure which fetch implementation to use via the `fetchSupport` configuration option in your `generators.yml` file.

      ### Configuration Options

      **`fetchSupport: "native"` (default)**

      Uses the native fetch API available in modern JavaScript runtimes. This is the recommended option for most use cases as it:
      - Has no external dependencies (no `node-fetch` package required)
      - Works seamlessly in Node.js 18+, browsers, Deno, Bun, and edge runtimes
      - Results in a smaller bundle size

      **`fetchSupport: "node-fetch"`**

      Uses the `node-fetch` package as a polyfill. This option:
      - Adds `node-fetch` as a dependency to your generated SDK
      - Provides compatibility with older Node.js versions (though Node.js 18+ is still required)
      - Falls back to the global fetch if available

      ### Usage

      To configure the fetch implementation, add the `fetchSupport` option to your `generators.yml`:

      ```yaml
      groups:
        production:
          generators:
            - name: fernapi/fern-typescript-node-sdk
              version: latest
              config:
                fetchSupport: native  # or "node-fetch"
      ```

      The default value is `"native"`, so you only need to specify this option if you want to use `node-fetch`.
