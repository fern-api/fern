## [0.1.0] - 2024-02-11
- Fix: The Postman generator no longer times out on the latest CLI version. 
  
  The generator would previously throw on additional fields being present in the IR, which would prevent
  Fern from adding new fields. Now, the generator does not throw if additional fields are present.


## [0.0.46] - 2024-02-09
