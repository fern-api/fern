# Playground

Welcome to the Fern Ruby playground, here are steps to set up your Ruby environment and playaround with codegen.

## Setting up Ruby
https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/#homebrew
```sh
brew install ruby
```

### rbenv - Ruby Version Management
https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv
```sh
brew install rbenv ruby-build
```


## CLI testing
Similar to running `python` you can pull up an interactive Ruby shall by running `irb`, with this you can now run Ruby commands, import Gems, etc.!


## Installation for this Gem

TODO: Replace `UPDATE_WITH_YOUR_GEM_NAME_PRIOR_TO_RELEASE_TO_RUBYGEMS_ORG` with your gem name right after releasing it to RubyGems.org. Please do not do it earlier due to security reasons. Alternatively, replace this section with instructions to install your gem from git if you don't plan to release to RubyGems.org.

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add UPDATE_WITH_YOUR_GEM_NAME_PRIOR_TO_RELEASE_TO_RUBYGEMS_ORG

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install UPDATE_WITH_YOUR_GEM_NAME_PRIOR_TO_RELEASE_TO_RUBYGEMS_ORG

## Usage of this Gem

TODO: Write usage instructions here
