  - id: EXCEPTION_HANDLING

      When the API returns a non-success status code (4xx or 5xx response), an exception will be thrown.

  - id: CUSTOM_CLIENT
    advanced: true
    description: |
      This SDK is built to work with any HTTP client that implements Guzzle's `ClientInterface`.
      By default, if no client is provided, the SDK will use Guzzle's default HTTP client.
      However, you can pass your own client that adheres to `ClientInterface`:

  - id: PAGINATION
    description: |
      List endpoints return a `Pager<T>` which lets you loop over all items and the SDK will automatically make multiple HTTP requests for you.

  - id: RETRIES
    advanced: true
    description: |
      The SDK is instrumented with automatic retries with exponential backoff. A request will be retried as long
      as the request is deemed retryable and the number of retry attempts has not grown larger than the configured
      retry limit (default: 2).

      A request is deemed retryable when any of the following HTTP status codes is returned:

      - [408](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/408) (Timeout)
      - [429](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429) (Too Many Requests)
      - [5XX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/500) (Internal Server Errors)

      Use the `maxRetries` request option to configure this behavior.

  - id: TIMEOUTS
    advanced: true
    description: |
      The SDK defaults to a 30 second timeout. Use the `timeout` option to configure this behavior.
