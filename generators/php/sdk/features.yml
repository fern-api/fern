      Instantiate and use the client with the following:

  - id: EXCEPTION_HANDLING
    description: |
      When the API returns a non-success status code (4xx or 5xx response), an exception will be thrown.

  - id: CUSTOM_CLIENT

      Life is unexpected more than we can anticipate, and for those special cases, you can pass your own PSR compatible HTTP Client
      with whatever middleware your heart desires, all you need to do is pass your own client implementation to our client
      constructor. Here's an example of how you can register a custom middleware on the client:

  - id: PAGINATION
    description: |
      List endpoints return a `Pager<T>` which lets you loop over all items and the SDK will automatically make multiple HTTP requests for you.

  - id: RETRIES
    advanced: true
    description: |
      The SDK is instrumented with automatic retries with exponential backoff. A request will be retried as long
      as the request is deemed retryable and the number of retry attempts has not grown larger than the configured
      retry limit (default: 2).

      A request is deemed retryable when any of the following HTTP status codes is returned:

      - [408](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/408) (Timeout)
      - [429](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429) (Too Many Requests)
      - [5XX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/500) (Internal Server Errors)

      Use the `maxRetries` request option to configure this behavior.

  - id: TIMEOUTS
    advanced: true
    description: |
      The SDK defaults to a 30 second timeout. Use the `timeout` option to configure this behavior.
