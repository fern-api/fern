  - id: USAGE
    description: |
      Instantiate and use the client with the following:

  - id: ERRORS
    description: |
      The SDK throws a single error enum for all failures. Client-side issues encoding/decoding failures and network errors use dedicated cases, while non-success HTTP responses are wrapped in an `HTTPError` that exposes the status code, a simple classification and an optional decoded message.

  - id: REQUEST_TYPES
    description: |
      The SDK exports all request types as Swift structs. Simply import the SDK module to access them:

  - id: ADDITIONAL_HEADERS
    advanced: true
    description: |
      If you would like to send additional headers as part of the request, use the `additionalHeaders` request option.

  - id: ADDITIONAL_QUERY_STRING_PARAMETERS
    advanced: true
    description: |
      If you would like to send additional query string parameters as part of the request, use the `additionalQueryParameters` request option.

  - id: TIMEOUTS
    advanced: true
    description: |
      The SDK defaults to a 60-second timeout. Use the `timeout` option to configure this behavior.

  - id: CUSTOM_NETWORKING_CLIENT
    advanced: true
    description: |
      The SDK allows you to customize the underlying `URLSession` used for HTTP requests. Use the `urlSession` option to provide your own configured `URLSession` instance.
