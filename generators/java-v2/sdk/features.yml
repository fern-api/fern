features:
  - id: USAGE
    description: |
      Instantiate and use the client with the following:

  - id: ENVIRONMENTS
    description: |
      This SDK allows you to configure different environments for API requests.

  - id: BASE_URL
    description: |
      You can set a custom base URL when constructing the client.

  - id: PAGINATION
    description: |
      Paginated requests will return an Iterable<T>, which can be used to loop through the underlying items, or stream them. You can also call
      `nextPage` to perform the pagination manually

  - id: EXCEPTION_HANDLING
    description: |
      When the API returns a non-success status code (4xx or 5xx response), an API exception will be thrown.

  - id: CUSTOM_CLIENT
    advanced: true
    description: |
      This SDK is built to work with any instance of `OkHttpClient`. By default, if no client is provided, the SDK will construct one.
      However, you can pass your own client like so:

  - id: RETRIES
    advanced: true
    description: |
      The SDK is instrumented with automatic retries with exponential backoff. A request will be retried as long
      as the request is deemed retryable and the number of retry attempts has not grown larger than the configured
      retry limit (default: 2). Before defaulting to exponential backoff, the SDK will first attempt to respect
      the `Retry-After` header (as either in seconds or as an HTTP date), and then the `X-RateLimit-Reset` header
      (as a Unix timestamp in epoch seconds); failing both of those, it will fall back to exponential backoff.

      A request is deemed retryable when any of the following HTTP status codes is returned:

      - [408](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/408) (Timeout)
      - [429](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429) (Too Many Requests)
      - [5XX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/500) (Internal Server Errors)

      Use the `maxRetries` client option to configure this behavior.

  - id: TIMEOUTS
    advanced: true
    description: |
      The SDK defaults to a 60 second timeout. You can configure this with a timeout option at the client or request level.

  - id: CUSTOM_HEADERS
    advanced: true
    description: |
      The SDK allows you to add custom headers to requests. You can configure headers at the client level or at the request level.

  - id: ACCESS_RAW_RESPONSE_DATA
    advanced: true
    description: |
      The SDK provides access to raw response data, including headers, through the `withRawResponse()` method.
      The `withRawResponse()` method returns a raw client that wraps all responses with `body()` and `headers()` methods.
      (A normal client's `response` is identical to a raw client's `response.body()`.)
