  - id: USAGE
    description: |
      Instantiate and use the client with the following:

  - id: ENVIRONMENTS

  - id: PAGINATION
    description: |
      List endpoints are paginated. The SDK provides an iterator so that you can simply loop over the items. You can also iterate page-by-page.

  - id: ERRORS
    description: |
      Structured error types are returned from API calls that return non-success status codes. These errors are compatible
      with the Ruby Core API, so you can access the error like so:

  - id: REQUEST_OPTIONS
    description: |
      A variety of request options are included to adapt the behavior of the library, which includes configuring
      authorization tokens, or providing your own instrumented `HTTP::Client`.

      These request options can either be specified on the client so that they're applied on every request, 
      or for an individual request, like so:

  - id: TIMEOUTS
    advanced: true
    description: |
      The SDK defaults to a 60 second timeout. Use the `timeout` option to configure this behavior.
