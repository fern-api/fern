      Instantiate and use the client with the following:

  - id: ENVIRONMENTS

  - id: PAGINATION
    description: |
      List endpoints are paginated. The SDK provides an iterator so that you can simply loop over the items. You can also iterate page-by-page.

  - id: ERRORS
    description: |
      Structured error types are returned from API calls that return non-success status codes. These errors are compatible
      with the Ruby Core API, so you can access the error like so:

  - id: TIMEOUTS
    advanced: true
    description: |
      The SDK defaults to a 60 second timeout. Use the `timeout` option to configure this behavior.
