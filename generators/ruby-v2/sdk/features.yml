  - id: ENVIRONMENTS

  - id: PAGINATION
    description: |
      List endpoints are paginated. The SDK provides an iterator so that you can simply loop over the items. You can also iterate page-by-page.

  - id: ERRORS
    description: |
      Failed API calls will raise errors that can be rescued from granularly.

  - id: RETRIES
    advanced: true
    description: |
      The SDK is instrumented with automatic retries. A request will be retried as long as the request is deemed
      retryable and the number of retry attempts has not grown larger than the configured retry limit (default: 2).

      A request is deemed retryable when any of the following HTTP status codes is returned:

      - [408](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/408) (Timeout)
      - [429](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429) (Too Many Requests)
      - [5XX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/500) (Internal Server Errors)

      Use the `max_retries` option to configure this behavior.

  - id: TIMEOUTS
    advanced: true
    description: |
      The SDK defaults to a 60 second timeout. Use the `timeout` option to configure this behavior.

  - id: ADDITIONAL_HEADERS
    advanced: true
    description: |
      If you would like to send additional headers as part of the request, use the `additional_headers` request option.

  - id: ADDITIONAL_QUERY_PARAMETERS
    advanced: true
    description: |
      If you would like to send additional query parameters as part of the request, use the `additional_query_parameters` request option.
