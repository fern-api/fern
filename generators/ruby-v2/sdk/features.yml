features:
  - id: USAGE
    description: |
      Instantiate and use the client with the following:

  - id: ENVIRONMENTS
    description: |
      You can choose between different environments by using the `base_url` option. You can configure any arbitrary base
      URL, which is particularly useful in test environments.

  - id: PAGINATION
    description: |
      List endpoints are paginated. The SDK provides an iterator so that you can simply loop over the items. You can also iterate page-by-page.

  - id: ERRORS
    description: |
      Structured error types are returned from API calls that return non-success status codes. These errors are compatible
      with the Ruby Core API, so you can access the error like so:

  - id: REQUEST_OPTIONS
    description: |
      A variety of request options are included to adapt the behavior of the library, which includes configuring
      authorization tokens, or providing your own instrumented `HTTP::Client`.

      These request options can either be specified on the client so that they're applied on every request, 
      or for an individual request, like so:

  - id: RESPONSE_HEADERS
    advanced: true
    description: |
      You can access the raw HTTP response data by using the `WithRawResponse` field on the client. This is useful
      when you need to examine the response headers received from the API call.

  - id: RETRIES
    advanced: true
    description: |
      The SDK is instrumented with automatic retries with exponential backoff. A request will be retried as long
      as the request is deemed retryable and the number of retry attempts has not grown larger than the configured
      retry limit (default: 2).

      A request is deemed retryable when any of the following HTTP status codes is returned:

      - [408](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/408) (Timeout)
      - [429](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429) (Too Many Requests)
      - [5XX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/500) (Internal Server Errors)

      Use the `max_retries` option to configure this behavior for the entire client or an individual request:

  - id: TIMEOUTS
    advanced: true
    description: |
      The SDK defaults to a 60 second timeout. Use the `timeout` option to configure this behavior.
