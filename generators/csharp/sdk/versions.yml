                ["extra3"] = 99
            }
        };

        var response = await client.Foo.CreateAsync(request);

        Dictionary<string, JsonElement> jsonElements = response.AdditionalProperties.ToJsonElementDictionary();
        Dictionary<string, int> extra1 = jsonElements["extra1"].Deserialize<Dictionary<string, int>>();
        DateTime extra2 = jsonElements["extra2"].GetDateTime();
        int extra3 = jsonElements["extra3"].GetInt32();
        ````

        To enable this feature, configure `experimental-additional-properties: true` in the `config` section of your C# generator in generators.yml.
        This will become the default in the future.

        Forward compatible enums has a static method `Custom(string value)` that allows you to create a new instance of the enum with a custom value.
        "Custom" is a commonly used enum value, and we want to avoid conflicts with the static method, so we're renaming the static method to `FromCustom(string value)`.
        This feature is gated behind the `experimental-enable-forward-compatible-enums` configuration option, so we're accepting this as a breaking change without a major version bump.

      summary: |
        Generate **discriminated unions** with:
        - Type safety with compile-time checking
        - Exhaustive discriminant value matching
        - JSON serialization support

        Here's a simple example how to use a shape discriminated union:
        ```csharp
        var shape = new Shape(new Circle { Radius = 5 });

        // Type checking
        if (shape.IsCircle) {
            Console.WriteLine($"Radius: {circle.AsCircle().Radius}");
        }

        // Discriminant value matching
        var area = shape.Match(
            circle => Math.PI * circle.Radius * circle.Radius,
            square => square.Length * square.Length,
            (type, _) => throw new NotSupportedException($"Unknown: {type}")
        );

        // TryAs pattern
        if (shape.TryAsCircle(out var circle)) {
            Console.WriteLine($"Radius: {circle.Radius}");
        }
        ```

        This feature is off by default for backward compatibility.
        To enable it, set `use-discriminated-unions` to `true` in the generator configuration.

        ```csharp
        // Call the endpoint.
        var response = await client.GetUser(...);

        // Print the additional properties.

        Add forward-compatible enums.
        Set `experimental-enable-forward-compatible-enums` to `true` in the configuration to generate forward-compatible enums.

        With forward-compatible enums you can create and parse an enum value that is not predefined.

        - Forward compatible enums are not compatible with the previously generated native enums.
          This is a breaking change for the users of the generated SDK, but only users using switch-case statements are affected.
        - Use the `Value` property to get the string value of the enum.
        - For each value in the enum,
          - a public static property is generated, which is an instance of the enum class,
          - a public static property is generated within the nested `Values` class with the string value of the enum.

        Here's a before and after for creating and parsing a resource with a predefined enum value and a custom enum value:

        **Before**:

        ```csharp
        var resource = client.CreateResource(new Resource { Id = "2", EnumProperty = MyEnum.Value2 } );
        // The line below does not compile because the enum does not have a `Value3` value.
        // resource = client.CreateResource(new Resource { Id = "3", EnumProperty = MyEnum.Value3 } );
        resource = client.GetResource("3");
        switch(resource.EnumProperty)
        {
            case MyEnum.Value1:
                Console.WriteLine("Value1");
                break;
            case MyEnum.Value2:
                Console.WriteLine("Value2");
                break;
            default:
                // this will never be reached until the SDK is updated with the new enum value
                Console.WriteLine("Unknown");
                break;
        }
        if(resource.EnumProperty == MyEnum.Value1)
        {
                Console.WriteLine("Value1");
        }
        else if (resource.EnumProperty == MyEnum.Value2)
        {
                Console.WriteLine("Value2");
        }
        else
        {
            // this will never be reached until the SDK is updated with the new enum value
            Console.WriteLine("Unknown");
        }
        ```

        No exception is thrown, but the output incorrectly shows `Value1` because .NET falls back to the first value in the enum.

        **After**:

        ```csharp
        var resource = client.CreateResource(new Resource { Id = "2", EnumProperty = MyEnum.Value2 } );
        resource = client.CreateResource(new Resource { Id = "3", EnumProperty = MyEnum.Custom("value3") } );
        resource = client.GetResource("3");
        switch(resource.EnumProperty.Value)
        {
            case MyEnum.Values.Value1:
                Console.WriteLine("Value1");
                break;
            case MyEnum.Values.Value2:
                Console.WriteLine("Value2");
                break;
            default:
                Console.WriteLine(resource.EnumProperty.Value);
                break;
        }
        if(resource.EnumProperty == MyEnum.Value1)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Value1");
        }
        else if (resource.EnumProperty == MyEnum.Value2)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Value2");
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine(resource.EnumProperty.Value);
        }
        ```

        The output correctly shows `Value3`.
