    description: |
      When the API returns a non-success status code (4xx or 5xx response), a subclass of the following error
      will be thrown.

  - id: PAGINATION
    description: |
      List endpoints are paginated. The SDK provides an async enumerable so that you can simply loop over the items:

  - id: RETRIES
    advanced: true
    description: |
      The SDK is instrumented with automatic retries with exponential backoff. A request will be retried as long
      as the request is deemed retryable and the number of retry attempts has not grown larger than the configured
      retry limit (default: 2).

      A request is deemed retryable when any of the following HTTP status codes is returned:

      - [408](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/408) (Timeout)
      - [429](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429) (Too Many Requests)
      - [5XX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/500) (Internal Server Errors)

      Use the `MaxRetries` request option to configure this behavior.

  - id: TIMEOUTS
    advanced: true
    description: |
      The SDK defaults to a 30 second timeout. Use the `Timeout` option to configure this behavior.

  - id: FORWARD_COMPATIBLE_ENUMS
    advanced: true
    description: |
      This SDK uses forward-compatible enums that can handle unknown values gracefully.
